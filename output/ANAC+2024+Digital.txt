6   I  2024
To a large extent, climbing has taught me everything. The act of climbing, its 
requisite engagement with the natural world, its physical complexities, its emotional 
breadth, its spiritual depths, its human interactions. For me, nothing else is as 
complete. Climbing has also taught me to be more human—that is, fallible in both 
capability and assumption. Climbing accidents have taught me that what I imagine 
to be true can be faulty or inadequate. 
Last year, in one of the many incidents reported in this edition, a very 
experienced leader, after climbing into a quandary, deliberately hopped off a 
route in West Virginia while on lead. His rope was cut clean through. His rope was 
not running over an edge, his gear was in perfect working order, and his partner 
made no mistakes.
Last year, several climbers reported that they fell either deliberately or 
incidentally on bolted sport routes, and in the process their carabiners broke. In each

Last year, several climbers reported that they fell either deliberately or 
incidentally on bolted sport routes, and in the process their carabiners broke. In each 
case, there was no fault in the hardware, nor was there any notable user error. 
Last year, a climber fell, unroped, from the fourth belay anchor on a 15-pitch 
climb in the Canadian Rockies. After tumbling 115 feet, he came to rest on a ledge 
three pitches above the ground, having suffered only minor injuries. One might 
attribute this incident—especially when held opposite the equally implausible 
examples above—to benign intervention, a guidance bordering on the divine. Or one 
might say, it was merely good luck.
This book is filled with examples of good luck and bad—mainly the latter. But

neither form of chance has anything to do with some alarming trends. Free solo 
deaths are becoming alarmingly frequent. Further on, you’ll read of an unusual 
rescue of a stranded free soloist who had virtually no outdoor climbing experience. 
Luck also plays no role in accidents that basic skills would have prevented. In this 
y e a r ’s A NAC reporting, all 13 accidents caused by or aggravated by pulled protection 
involved failed cam placements. None of the pulled protection, whether placed by 
a novice or experienced climber, was a nut, hex, or Tricam. Like fast food, cams are 
fast, easy, and convenient. But a novice trad leader’s diet should stress the use of 
passive gear to teach the basic principles of protection.

the moment, it can drown out the faint whispers of prudence. Climbing draws a 
thin line between potential and peril. And for the inexperienced climber, magical 
thinking—a poor substitute for know-how and informed judgment—is too often 
applied to running it out to the chains, yarding on a creaky flake, or plodding upward 
into a snowstorm.
As an elective passion, climbing promises a glimpse of the unimaginable and the 
astounding—but please remember, these adjectives are also used when describing 
the aftermath of an accident. Considering it all, one might think that climbing is not 
a prudent pursuit—and one would be right. Climbing is not entirely prudent. It is 
beautiful and it is dangerous. Stay safe out there.

MOUNTAIN MEDICINE
Acclimatization and High Altitude 
Illness: Assessment and Treatment
By Peter Hackett, M.D. & Dave Weber 
High altitude illness (HAI) occurs when climbers are exposed to lower barometric 
pressure due to elevation gain. While ambient air is always composed of 21 percent 
oxygen, the less dense air at high altitude results in fewer available oxygen 
molecules and thus less oxygen in the lungs, blood, and tissues. 
When a climber does not take adequate time to acclimatize to a new altitude, 
signs and symptoms (S/S) of HAI can manifest. The effects can range from mild 
to life-threatening. Early recognition and treatment are essential to minimize the 
severity of high altitude illness. The following recommendations are largely based on 
the 2024 update of the Wilderness Medical Society’s (WMS) Consensus Guidelines 
for the Prevention and Treatment of Acute Altitude Illness.
Acclimatization
------------------------------
the 2024 update of the Wilderness Medical Society’s (WMS) Consensus Guidelines 
for the Prevention and Treatment of Acute Altitude Illness.
Acclimatization
The human body can adjust to moderate hypoxia, reduced oxygen in the body tissues, 
at elevations less than 17,000 feet (5,182 meters) but requires time to do so. Acute 
NPS rescue personnel and volunteers treat a HAPE/HACE patient at 14,200-foot camp on Denali. 
This portable and inflatable hyperbaric chamber is used to simulate emergent descent for severe 
cases of high altitude illness prior to evacuation or when descent is not possible. Menno Boermans
8  I  ACCIDENTS IN NORTH AMERICAN CLIMBING 2024
------------------------------
exposure to altitude is associated with a steady increase in ventilation (breathing 
rate and depth), improved oxygenation, and changes in cerebral (brain) blood flow. 
Later phases of acclimatization are marked by increased production of red blood cells 
(oxygen-carrying cells). 
In general, high altitude illness affects climbers at sleeping elevations greater than 
8,000 feet (2,438 meters). As the altitude increases, so does the risk of HAI. The rate of 
ascent, however, is the most important factor when assessing risk. 
The WMS recommends avoiding ascents to a sleeping altitude of over 9,000 
feet (2,743 meters) in one day from low altitude (less than 3,000 feet/914 meters) 
and increasing sleeping elevation by no more than 1,500 feet (~460 meters) per day 
when above 9,000 feet. In addition, the WMS guidelines recommend an extra day 
of acclimatization for every 3,000 feet of sleeping elevation gain. If a route requires

when above 9,000 feet. In addition, the WMS guidelines recommend an extra day 
of acclimatization for every 3,000 feet of sleeping elevation gain. If a route requires 
larger elevation gains between camps, it is best to sleep at one elevation for two or 
more days while traveling to higher altitudes on day trips (hence the popular adage 
of “climb high and sleep low”).
These recommendations are general, and the pace of acclimatization will be too 
slow for some and too fast for others. Climbers must pay attention to their bodies, and 
their partners, and recognize the early symptoms of altitude illness.
Under physician direction, the medication acetazolamide (Diamox) can be 
used to speed up the natural process of acclimatization and thus help prevent 
acute mountain sickness (AMS). Climbers at altitude should avoid consumption of 
products that depress their innate respiratory drive, such as sedative medications 
and alcoholic beverages. 
Case Study

products that depress their innate respiratory drive, such as sedative medications 
and alcoholic beverages. 
Case Study
Failure to heed the HAI preventive measures listed above can have severe 
consequences. This point is highlighted in the unfortunate death of a 24-year-old 
male climber on Denali in 2023 (see page 23). 
On May 30, National Park Service (NPS) mountaineering rangers at 14,200-foot 
camp (4,328 meters) were notified that a climber on an independent six-person ski-
mountaineering team had repeatedly lost consciousness. His teammates informed 
the rangers that this climber appeared to be exhibiting signs and symptoms of 
high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), 
following a rapid, one-and-a-half-day ascent from Kahiltna Base Camp at 7,200 
feet to 14,200-foot camp. The team also reported that a second climber on their 
team was exhibiting signs and symptoms of HAPE.
------------------------------
feet to 14,200-foot camp. The team also reported that a second climber on their 
team was exhibiting signs and symptoms of HAPE. 
Poor weather prevented rapid evacuation by helicopter for the next 18 hours. 
The mountaineering rangers and their medical volunteers performed advanced life 
support measures throughout the night and for the duration of the weather hold. 
Treatments included a portable hyperbaric chamber, emergency HAI medications, 
supplemental oxygen, and mechanical breathing assistance. Despite these efforts, 
the climber never regained consciousness and remained unresponsive. 
When the weather cleared on May 31, the NPS helicopter flew to 14,200-foot 
camp with a National Guard pararescue specialist aboard to evacuate the climber to 
Talkeetna. The climber was then flown via air ambulance to a hospital in Anchorage, 
where he died the following day as a result of severe high altitude illness.
KNOW THE ROPES  I  9
------------------------------
This sobering incident underlines the necessity of adequate acclimatization 
during any high altitude expedition. Adding a few days to this team’s ascent profile 
would have resulted in little or no HAI signs and symptoms for the climbers.  
Assessment
High altitude illness encompasses three categories: acute mountain sickness (AMS), 
high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), and high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). 
Acute mountain sickness represents the mildest—and most common—form of high 
altitude illness. AMS is estimated to affect 25 percent of all visitors to Colorado who 
sleep above 8,000 feet, for example. HACE and HAPE are severe presentations of 
high altitude illness that are, fortunately, far less common.
AMS occurs when a non-acclimatized climber ascends to an altitude more rapidly 
than their body can adjust. The onset of AMS is usually within hours of ascent or 
after the first night of sleeping at altitude.
------------------------------
than their body can adjust. The onset of AMS is usually within hours of ascent or 
after the first night of sleeping at altitude. 
High altitude cerebral edema is severe AMS characterized by fluid accumulation 
(edema) within the brain—it usually takes two to three days to develop. The 
incidence of HACE is rare, especially at elevations below 14,000 feet (4,267 meters). 
HACE generally follows AMS or HAPE. 
High altitude pulmonary edema is caused by excessive fluid leaking from 
capillaries within the lungs, and most often occurs two to three days after ascent to 
high altitude. HAPE is also uncommon and can occur by itself or in conjunction with 
AMS and HACE. Approximately one out of 10,000 skiers visiting Colorado and less 
than one out of 100 travelers above 14,000 feet (4,267 meters) suffer from HAPE.  
Signs and Symptoms of High Altitude Illness
The following signs and symptoms are the most common presentations for each of the 
high altitude illnesses (AMS, HACE, and HAPE).
------------------------------
Signs and Symptoms of High Altitude Illness
The following signs and symptoms are the most common presentations for each of the 
high altitude illnesses (AMS, HACE, and HAPE).
Acute Mountain Sickness 
• Headache accompanied by at least one of the following:
• Loss of appetite, nausea, and sometimes vomiting
• Insomnia
• Fatig ue
• Dizziness or lightheadedness
• Patients often report that AMS feels much like a hangover
High Altitude Cerebral Edema 
• Ataxia (difficulties with coordination and gross motor movements, e.g., 
walking; patient may appear intoxicated)
• Mental status changes (including disorientation, irritability, combativeness, 
and/or unresponsiveness)
• Headache and other AMS signs and symptoms possible 
• HAPE often present
High Altitude Pulmonary Edema 
• Shortness of breath (respiratory distress) with exercise at first
• Shortness of breath when resting later
• Excessive fatigue
• Persistent cough (initially dry, then becoming productive)

• Shortness of breath (respiratory distress) with exercise at first
• Shortness of breath when resting later
• Excessive fatigue
• Persistent cough (initially dry, then becoming productive)
10  I  ACCIDENTS IN NORTH AMERICAN CLIMBING 2024
------------------------------
• Gurgling sensation in the chest
• Very low pulse oximeter value (usually less than 70—80 percent, depending 
on the altitude)
Note: Pulse oximetry (SpO2) monitors can be useful for monitoring an 
individual’s oxygen saturation trend over time. However, persons with AMS can 
have normal values for the altitude, and many climbers with low values are not ill. 
That said, SpO2 values are always low with HAPE. The normal value for a given 
altitude can be estimated by the average readings of well climbers in the group.
Field Treatment 
The lists below highlight treatments that are both effective and practical in field 
settings. It is critical that any treatments recommended for AMS, HACE, and HAPE 
be realistic for typical high altitude mountain environments.
Acute Mountain Sickness 
The most prudent treatment is to stop the ascent and allow the climber to 
acclimatize until S/S resolve. Rest days should be active while maintaining 
appropriate nutrition and hydration. In addition:
------------------------------
acclimatize until S/S resolve. Rest days should be active while maintaining 
appropriate nutrition and hydration. In addition:
• Consider acetazolamide (Diamox).*
• Treat symptoms (e.g. headache, nausea) with over-the-counter medications. 
• Supplemental oxygen can be administered if available.
• Descend if climber does not improve or if S/S of HACE/HAPE present. 
High Altitude Cerebral Edema
The highest-priority treatment is prompt descent until S/S resolve. During descent:
• Supplemental oxygen should be administered if available.
• Administer dexamethasone (Decadron)* and continue until improvement  
with descent. 
• A portable hyperbaric chamber can be used temporarily if descent  
is not possible.
High Altitude Pulmonary Edema
The highest-priority treatment is prompt descent until S/S resolve. During descent:

foot camp. Menno Boermans
KNOW THE ROPES  I  11
------------------------------
• Supplemental oxygen should be administerd if available.
• Consider inhaled albuterol (Ventolin).* 
• Administer oral nifedipine (Procardia).*
• A portable hyperbaric chamber can be temporarily used if descent  
is not possible. 
Note that HACE and HAPE can occur simultaneously, and differential diagnosis 
can prove difficult. For this reason, some experts recommend initially treating 
severe HAI patients with neurological S/S for both HACE and HAPE until a 
definitive diagnosis is established.  
Hospital Treatment
Treatment of HAI in the hospital or clinic is similar to the field management 
strategies described above. Climbers suffering from HAI usually improve simply 
with transport to a lower elevation. HACE/HAPE patients should be assessed and 
monitored for any prolonged neurological and/or respiratory aftereffects. 
*Administration of any medication requires both wilderness medicine training 
and physician orders/protocols.

My wife—an ICU nurse—and I recently attended a course reviewing safe travel 
in avalanche terrain, warning signs of avalanche, and how to perform avalanche 
companion rescue. These courses excel at teaching these aspects, but due to time 
constraints, they fail to delve into the realities of longer-term patient management 
following a successful rescue. 
My curiosity on this topic led to additional self-study and revealed knowledge 
gaps regarding the morbidity of avalanche victims. An eagerness to close these 
gaps connected me with medical and avalanche professionals in Salt Lake City 
and Jackson, Wyoming. These subject matter experts—including physicians, SAR 
personnel, and avalanche forecasters—have spent decades researching avalanche 
morbidity. Their research includes common causes of avalanche-related death and 
practical first-aid treatments.

management. Dave Weber
“considerable,” “high,” and “extreme danger.” Most fatalities occur when 
danger is “considerable.”
• Most avalanches occur between 30 and 45 degrees. 
• Many alpine climbing routes follow gully and couloir terrain features that 
create a funnel for avalanche slopes above. These “terrain traps” bury victims 
deeper than average.
• Two primary classifications: partial burial—where the victim is buried and their 
airway remains above the surface; complete/full burial—where the victim’s 
airway is beneath the surface.
• The likelihood of surviving a partial avalanche burial is approximately 95 
percent. The likelihood of surviving a complete/full burial is 50 percent.

percent. The likelihood of surviving a complete/full burial is 50 percent.
Causes of Death
Three causes of death are commonly linked to avalanche fatalities: asphyxia, 
trauma, and hypothermia. Approximately 75 percent of avalanche fatalities are due 
to asphyxiation, 25 percent are trauma-related, and a small percentage are caused 
by hypothermia.
 Asphyxia is a condition resulting from insufficient oxygen intake and can lead 
to death within 15 to 20 minutes. Three mechanisms cause asphyxiation: oxygen 
deprivation, airway blockage, and ice mask formation.
Oxygen Deprivation
Ambient air contains 21 percent oxygen and 0.04 percent carbon dioxide. Conversely, 
human exhalation contains 16 percent oxygen and 4 percent carbon dioxide. 
Avalanche debris has very little porosity and is not permeable to outside air. If an air 
pocket exists surrounding a buried victim, it quickly becomes enriched with carbon
------------------------------
Avalanche debris has very little porosity and is not permeable to outside air. If an air 
pocket exists surrounding a buried victim, it quickly becomes enriched with carbon 
dioxide and depleted of oxygen during normal breathing. The continued rebreathing 
of this air mixture eventually causes asphyxiation due to hypoxia. This mechanism 
is the most common cause of avalanche deaths. 
KNOW THE ROPES  I  13
------------------------------
Airway Blockage
When a victim is entrained in an avalanche, their clothing, boots, and equipment are 
packed with snow. This phenomenon is also true of their airway, which includes the 
mouth and nose. As snow fills the oral and nasal cavities, it causes an impenetrable 
barrier to the passage of air into the lungs and leads to asphyxiation. 
Ice Mask Formation
During inhalation of ambient air, the body humidifies dry air as a protective 
measure for upper airway structures and the lungs. During exhalation, the 
expired air contains water vapor. This water vapor is visible to climbers during 
winter months due to condensation of vapor in cold air. During an avalanche 
burial, exhaled water vapor condenses and freezes in front of the victim’s 
airway. As this ice barrier develops, it prevents further inhalation and ultimately 
causes asphyxiation. 
As mentioned, trauma accounts for nearly 25 percent of avalanche deaths.

airway. As this ice barrier develops, it prevents further inhalation and ultimately 
causes asphyxiation. 
As mentioned, trauma accounts for nearly 25 percent of avalanche deaths. 
Multiple mechanisms of traumatic injury can occur during an avalanche. Avalanches 
can reach speeds greater than 60 mph (97 kph). Impacting terrain features, such 
as trees and rocks, at these speeds is a common cause of fatal trauma. Falling over 
cliff features is another means of traumatic injury when entrained in an avalanche. 
Trauma can cause death immediately or within 15 to 20 minutes of burial.
 Common traumatic injuries involve the head, neck, chest, arms, and legs, with 
many victims having multiple body regions affected. These multi-system injuries are 
devastating and difficult to survive. Traumatic injuries can cause internal bleeding 
in the chest, abdomen, and head cavities. Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are the most

devastating and difficult to survive. Traumatic injuries can cause internal bleeding 
in the chest, abdomen, and head cavities. Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are the most 
common type of head injury suffered. A TBI patient will commonly exhibit abnormal 
breathing patterns and have increased oxygen demands that may accelerate 
asphyxiation and further decrease chances of survival.
 Hypothermia is responsible for a small percentage of avalanche deaths. In 
general, snow is a good insulator. (Climbers often experience this characteristic 
in the warmth of a snow cave.) In general, it takes burial of an hour, or longer, for 
a victim to become hypothermic. For this reason, asphyxia and trauma are more 
prevalent causes of death in the early stages of burial. Avalanche victims are more 
likely to asphyxiate before succumbing to hypothermia. 
 That said, hypothermia can complicate the compromised physiologic

likely to asphyxiate before succumbing to hypothermia. 
 That said, hypothermia can complicate the compromised physiologic 
conditions of victims following a rescue. It represents one of the leading causes 
of death in typical trauma patients and should be managed during evacuation. 
Field treatments include providing warm and dry clothing to retain body heat 
and a vapor barrier (plastic bag, bivy sack, or tent fly) to protect the victim from 
wind and precipitation.
 Although this is anecdotal, climbers could be more susceptible to trauma as 
a cause of death versus snowmobilers, skiers, and snowboarders. The narrow 
confines that characterize climbing routes can compound the effects of even a small 
avalanche, exposing victims to trees, rocks, and deeper burials. This possibility was 
highlighted in the tragic avalanche accident in February 2023 that killed three out 
of six climbers ascending the tight, rocky chute of the Northeast Couloir of Colchuck

highlighted in the tragic avalanche accident in February 2023 that killed three out 
of six climbers ascending the tight, rocky chute of the Northeast Couloir of Colchuck 
Peak in Washington (see page 89). Three of the four climbers caught in the slide were 
not buried, but died from traumatic injuries.

Companion Rescue
There is a short survivability window for any avalanche victim. Most avalanche 
fatalities are caused by asphyxiation, so it is essential to locate and recover victims 
within 15 to 20 minutes of burial. Efficient companion rescue skills are the difference 
between life and death. Backcountry travelers should not rely on SAR teams. 
The odds of successful professional rescue are very low, given the hours required 
to mobilize. 
Avalanche First Aid
Numerous resources exist for 
current best practices including 
the International Commission 
on Alpine Rescue (ICAR) 
guidelines and the Wilderness 
Medical Society (WMS) 
Consensus Guidelines. However, 
some of that information is 
directed at advanced medical 
practitioners or environments 
with a more robust helicopter

recommendations, please refer 
to the Avalanche First Aid 
Algorithm chart (see above).  
When rescuing any 
avalanche victim, the priority 
should be exposing the head 
and chest as quickly as possible. 
Many rescue drills incorrectly 
focus on exposing the victim’s 
head. Unfortunately, as long 
as the chest remains buried, 
adequate respiration and 
ventilation are nearly impossible. 
After exposing the head and the chest, the victim should be assessed for signs 
of life. This is typically referred to as an initial patient assessment, or the ABC’s 
(Airway, Breathing, Circulation). The following is a list of considerations during the 
initial assessment:
• Is the victim responding spontaneously to voice commands or painful stimulus? 
• Is the victim spontaneously opening her/his eyes?
• Is the victim’s airway clear of snow? 
• Is the victim breathing spontaneously? 
• Does the victim have a pulse?
• What color are the victim’s lips, mouth, and face?
------------------------------
• Is the victim’s airway clear of snow? 
• Is the victim breathing spontaneously? 
• Does the victim have a pulse?

If a victim is breathing and responding when found, complete their excavation in 
order to assess for traumatic injuries to the head, neck, spine, chest, abdomen, pelvis,

and extremities. Rescuers should be proactive with management of hypothermia. 
Practically, this means providing warm and dry clothing to the victim, in addition to 
layers that protect from wind and precipitation. If additional help is required, rescue 
personnel can be notified by calling 911 or sending an emergency satellite message. 
If there are no signs of life (unresponsive, not breathing, no pulse), manually 
clear the airway of any snow/debris. Once cleared, the airway should be opened 
using the jaw thrust or head tilt—chin lift maneuver, as taught in a first-aid class. 
If the victim is breathing, rescuers should support breathing, finish the 
excavating process, treat for hypothermia, and plan for evacuation. If the 
victim is not breathing, deliver five rescue breaths. Ideally, a pocket mask 
should be used, but, if not, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is an option. Each 
rescue breath should last one to two seconds or until chest rise is observed.
------------------------------
should be used, but, if not, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is an option. Each 
rescue breath should last one to two seconds or until chest rise is observed. 
Each breath should be given six seconds apart. If the victim begins to breathe 
spontaneously after these initial breaths, support breathing and continue the 
patient assessment. 
If no spontaneous breathing occurs after these initial rescue breaths, check 
for a pulse for ten seconds or less. The preferred site is the carotid artery, which 
is located on the neck, below the jaw, and on either side of the trachea/windpipe. 
If no pulse is felt, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 
Begin CPR by performing 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 
compressions per minute. A metronome phone application set at 110 beats per 
minute can help maintain proper cadence. The American Heart Association

(AHA) recommends giving two rescue breaths after each round of 30 chest 
compressions. Five cycles of 30 compressions and two breaths should be 
completed before briefly reassessing (ten seconds or less) for the return of 
spontaneous breathing and/or a pulse.
If a victim is responsive, breathing and has a pulse, they should be thoroughly 
assessed for traumatic injuries. Initial assessment can be as simple as asking 
the victim if anything hurts. Palpate (feel) the entire body and note any 
abnormalities or areas of pain or tenderness. Spinal injury should be assumed 
on all unresponsive victims and efforts should be made to minimize movement 
of their head, neck, and spine. Once the physical examination is complete, basic 
first-aid treatments such as bandaging and splinting can be addressed while 
waiting for additional help or preparing for evacuation.
Withholding or Discontinuing Medical Care
------------------------------
first-aid treatments such as bandaging and splinting can be addressed while 
waiting for additional help or preparing for evacuation.
Withholding or Discontinuing Medical Care
There are scenarios where first aid will not help an avalanche victim and efforts 
should be withheld. If a scene is unsafe for rescuers, do not initiate rescue and/or 
escape to a safe zone and call for additional help. If there are obvious fatal injuries 
or the victim is completely frozen, first aid should not be initiated. If the victim 
was buried longer than 60 minutes, the airway is blocked with snow/debris, and the 
body is cold, the victim has likely died from asphyxia. 
If CPR has been in progress for greater than 30 minutes and no signs of life 
are present, CPR can be terminated. One exception to this time limit for CPR 
is for potential hypothermia victims. In the field, this is demarked by a burial 
longer than 60 minutes and an airway clear of snow/debris when found. Unlike for

Psychological First Aid
Involvment in an avalanche, as either a victim or a rescuer, can cause traumatic 
psychological stress, often with lasting effects. Psychological injuries often go 
unrecognized and untreated. These stress injuries have the potential to alter 
the lives of victims and rescuers alike. It is important for anyone involved in an 
avalanche to be familiar with and recognize these stressors. Laura McGladrey 
wrote an excellent article addressing the traumatic stress injuries in A NAC 2019. 
Baseline information and proven tactics were presented in this article.

Wilderness-specific medical courses are a step above these introductory trainings. 
Conclusion
When venturing into avalanche terrain, climbers, skiers, and companions are 
the best rescue resource when an accident occurs. The best means of rescuing an 
avalanche victim is to find them efficiently and utilize baseline avalanche rescue tools

FATAL FALL FROM ANCHOR | Inexperience, Inadequate

Alabama, Sand Rock, Sun Wall 
On October 14, Yutung “Faye” Zhang (18) fell 90 feet from the anchors of Misty 
(5.10b/c) while preparing to clean this route at Sand Rock in northeastern Alabama. 
It was her second time climbing outdoors. At around 12 p.m., Zhang, a new climber 
and part of a larger group, took a final top-rope lap on the route. She cleaned the 
quickdraws and reached the two-bolt anchor. The anchor was equipped with two 
mussy hooks plus a single locking carabiner that had been placed by one of the 
other climbers to prevent the rope from unclipping from the mussies. 
No one was at the anchors with Zhang to see exactly what happened. June C, 
who was belaying Zhang at the time of the accident, wrote on Mountain Project,

It is assumed that after removing the locking carabiner at the belay, Zhang 
somehow unclipped the rope from the mussy hooks. Jun C wrote, “Suddenly the 
rope became unweighted and she wasn’t clipped through the [hooks] anymore. I fell 
and smacked my back and head against another rock and she fell right beside me.... 
A few of us trained in emergency first response came to aid immediately as well as a 
physician that just happened to be in the area. EMS response was quite fast as well 
but there was really nothing to be done.”
June C added, “Between all of us we have decades of climbing experience. In 
our eyes, this [lowering from the mussy hooks] was routine and one of the safest 
things we could ask of a relatively new climber.” The belayer added, “At the same

time I know all of us are kicking ourselves for asking her to do anything at all.... 
We’ve all been thinking about what we could or should have done differently or 
how this could have been a safer experience.”
ANALYSIS
A few weeks after the accident, IFMGA guide Karsten Delap climbed the route and 
provided A NAC with some images and video. He observed that the best handholds 
at the end of Misty were located above the bolts. This may have positioned Zhang 
above the mussy hooks. Then, as Zhang weighted the rope, it might have loaded 
the hooks incorrectly and become unclipped. 
Delap wrote, “It is plausible that the rope was threaded from right to left on 
the mussy hooks, with the locking carabiner positioned between the two hooks. 
As the climber approached the anchor from the right side, an attempt to remove 
the locking carabiner involved pulling up above the mussy hooks to introduce
------------------------------
As the climber approached the anchor from the right side, an attempt to remove 
the locking carabiner involved pulling up above the mussy hooks to introduce 
slight slack into the system. While this facilitated the removal of the carabiner, 
it also inadvertently positioned the rope over the gates of the mussy hooks. The 
belayer, responding to the climber’s movement, probably took up slack, felt the 
climber’s weight, and subsequently the gates of the mussy hooks back-clipped 
under the full force of the climber’s weight. This resulted in the rope becoming 
dislodged from the anchor.” 
Delap also noted that the addition of a locking carabiner to this mussy hook 
belay was inappropriate for the system. In this case, the locker brought the rope 
above the plane of the hooks, a mistake when considering the “open” nature of a 
mussy hook. (See “Essentials” on the next page.)

mussy hook. (See “Essentials” on the next page.)
Greg Barnes, executive director of the American Safe Climbing Association 
(ASCA), is a proponent of lower-offs such as mussy hooks, but he says these 
useful tools still require education. He wrote to A NAC, “In Owens River Gorge, 
lower-offs [have been] the standard since the early ’90s. Despite very heavy 
climber traffic for 30 years, there have been very few anchor changeover accidents 
compared to similar areas with closed anchors. In the Sand Rock case, we don’t 
know whether the rope became accidentally unclipped or if the climber unclipped 
them on purpose. It is wise to have direct supervision—namely an experienced 
climber at the same anchor—when a new climber cleans an anchor.” (Sources:

ESSENTIALS
MUSSY HOOKS: BE A PRO, KEEP IT LOW
By Karsten Delap, lFMGA Guide
Mussy hooks, also known as open anchor 
hardware or lower-offs, have been used for 
decades at various single-pitch climbing areas. 
This type of anchor point not only makes it easy 
for a climber to clip and lower, but also provides 
sustainability for high-traffic areas due to the 
hardware’s durability. 
Mussy hooks have non-locking gates and, for 
various reasons, are usually installed so the gates 
face the same direction. This creates the potential 
for “back-clipping” to happen if the climber or rope 
is somehow positioned above the hooks. This also 
makes mussy hooks less than ideal for numerous 
climbers to use in a top-rope setting, because a 
slack rope with twists could unclip from the hooks. 
This scenario is very unlikely, but not impossible. 
For those using mussy hooks in a top-rope 
setting, the recommended practice is to establish

slack rope with twists could unclip from the hooks. 
This scenario is very unlikely, but not impossible. 
For those using mussy hooks in a top-rope 
setting, the recommended practice is to establish 
an anchor with a masterpoint below the plane of 
the hooks. When the last climber goes to clean the 
hooks, they will reach up to clip the rope above 
the temporary anchor into the hooks, then have 
the belayer take. All the climber’s weight will then 
be on the hooks and should be tested in a manner 
that confirms this; this also should unweight the 
temporary anchor, making it easy to clean. 
If the climber cannot unweight the rope from the 
temporary anchor, a PAS (personal anchor system) can be attached to the masterpoint 
of that anchor to hold the weight of the climber while they transfer the rope to the 
hooks. In either case, a key to safety is to position the temporary anchor low, so the 
climber cleaning the anchor must lift the rope up to clip the mussy hooks.
------------------------------
hooks. In either case, a key to safety is to position the temporary anchor low, so the 
climber cleaning the anchor must lift the rope up to clip the mussy hooks.
Whenever possible, the best practice when using mussy hooks is to ensure that your 
harness tie-in points, any temporary anchors, and the rope all stay below the mussy 
hooks until you’re ready to lower. So be a pro, keep it low.
It is strongly discouraged for inexperienced climbers to attempt to clean a route 
without proper and direct supervision. Many preventable accidents have occurred 
when inexperienced climbers clean a route for the first time. The safest and most 
effective way to learn this crucial skill is through the guidance of a certified instructor 
or guide in a controlled learning environment, where the progression of skills can be 
tailored to the individual climber’s needs.

injuries, one traumatic brain injury, one case of fractured ribs, one neck injury, 
and four patients with various musculoskeletal injuries)
• Frostbite: 11 cases
• Medical: Six cases (includes two cases of hypothermia, one diverticulitis, one 
spontaneous pneumothorax, one possible case of anxiety, and one case of 
anaphylaxis)

Twenty-one patients required helicopter evacuation from Denali National Park. 
Three patients were evacuated by NPS rangers on the ground, and nine patients 
self-evacuated after receiving treatment.
There were three mountaineering-related deaths in the Alaska Range during 
the 2023 climbing season, with an additional post-evacuation fatality. One 
occurred when a solo skier was caught in an avalanche. Two fatalities occurred 
due to a fall from the Mooses Tooth in the Ruth Gorge. On Denali’s West Buttress, 
a climber suffering from severe altitude illness was treated and evacuated, but 
subsequently died in hospital. (See individual reports below.)
Denali is the highest peak in North America. The name, derived from the Native Alaskan Koyukon 
language, means “the tall one.” High latitude and other factors make its 20,310-foot summit 
about 1000 feet physiologically higher than the same altitude in the Himalayas. NPS | Tim Rains

UNROPED CREVASSE FALL 
Denali, West Buttress Route 
On May 17, a 43-year-old female climber fell into a crevasse while unroped on 
Motorcycle Hill, above 11,200-foot camp. This climber was ascending without skis 
or snowshoes at the time of the fall. She was assisted out of the crevasse by one 
of her teammates and another private climber. The climber fell over 15 feet until 
stopping at the crevasse bottom and sustained a dislocated shoulder in the process.

of her teammates and another private climber. The climber fell over 15 feet until 
stopping at the crevasse bottom and sustained a dislocated shoulder in the process. 
The dislocation was successfully reduced, and the patient was transported by 
helicopter to 7,200-foot base camp once the weather cleared.
ANALYSIS
The year 2023 marks the third year in a row that NPS personnel have responded 
to an unroped crevasse fall in the Alaska Range. This year, the patient was 
fortunate. The crevasse falls in 2021 and 2022 proved fatal. The only sure way 
to mitigate crevasse fall hazard is by traveling as part of a rope team. While the 
use of a rope will not prevent a fall from occurring, it will reduce the fall distance 
and the likely severity of injury. Also, a means of floatation, such as skis or 
snowshoes, may reduce fall potential by distributing the weight of a climber over 
a greater surface area.

An unroped crevasse fall not only is risky for the individual, but also for other

not by professional rescuers. Climbers should consider this trend and assess their 
companion rescue plan prior to embarking on glaciated travel. (Source: Denali

At approximately 11 p.m. on May 19, a 24-year-old male climber was descending 
the ridge below 17,200-foot camp when he fell roughly 1,200 vertical feet onto 
the Peters Glacier. He and his climbing partner had just summited via the West

reported they were a few minutes from the fixed lines, at 16,200 feet, when the fall 
occurred. The partner was able to see the fallen climber on the Peters Glacier but 
was unable to make verbal contact. Due to the steep, crevassed terrain below the 
ridge, the partner made the decision to descend to 14,200-foot camp and notify 
NPS personnel.
Poor weather at the time of notification prevented helicopter evacuation, and 
a ground rescue was initiated. Due to the challenging access and remote nature 
of the patient’s location, the ground response team was prepared to spend an

extended period of time on the scene. 
However, the weather eventually 
cleared, allowing helicopter extrication 
20 hours after the fall. The patient 
sustained a closed head injury and 
extensive frostbite on both hands.
ANALYSIS
The ridge on the West Buttress Route 
between the top of the fixed lines, 
at 16,200 feet, and 17,200-foot camp 
has been the site of many falls. These 
have resulted in multiple injuries and 
fatalities. Guide services and the NPS 
maintain running protection in areas 
of high exposure along the ridge. 
However, the non-technical terrain 
has lured many into bypassing the 
running protection to move faster or to 
pass other parties. It is understandable 
that after completing a more technical 
route with higher exposure, like the 
West Rib, climbers may be more focused on returning to camp than taking added 
precautions. While this accident had a positive outcome, it could have easily ended

adequately for swift elevation gain. This is a severe example of the inaccuracies of 
this assumption. Living at altitude and having good fitness are not guaranteed to 
protect climbers against high altitude illness (HAI). The human body starts losing 
adaptions to altitude in a matter of days, which is often the amount of time that 
climbers spend traveling to Alaska to begin an expedition.
The Wilderness Medical Society (WMS) recommends that, at elevations above
------------------------------
climbers spend traveling to Alaska to begin an expedition.
The Wilderness Medical Society (WMS) recommends that, at elevations above 
9,000 feet, climbers ascend no more than 1,650 feet (500 meters) to a new sleeping 
elevation each night. Additionally, for every 3,300 feet (1,000 meters) of elevation 
gain, the WMS recommends spending an extra day sleeping at a given elevation to 
further acclimatize. (For more information on proper acclimatization, see the Know 
the Ropes article on page 8.) 
The mountaineering rangers on Denali see many very fit climbers arriving 
to attempt a summit each season. Although fitness is an important factor in risk 
management and safe travel on the mountain, it can also make the recommended 
conservative ascent profile feel onerous. Unfortunately, a climber’s level of fitness 
has no correlation with whether they become stricken with HAI. Only a reasonable 
ascent profile and proper acclimatization will prevent climbers from becoming ill.

STRANDED | Frostbite
Denali, West Buttress Route 
At approximately 10 a.m. on June 7, I (Jonathan Gopel, 31), Jacob Dong (21), 
and Heath Himstedt (37) began descending from 17,200-foot camp on the West 
Buttress. Bad weather and extreme cold played into our decision to descend 
without a summit. We appeared to be the first party to leave 17,200-foot camp 
that morning. We descended the ridge to the top of the fixed lines at 16,200 feet as 
quickly as conditions permitted, as it was windy and very cold and we were looking 
to get below the cloud layer to find better conditions.
As we reached the top of the fixed lines, we came upon a party of two 
mountaineers who signaled to us that they needed assistance. We made a brief

As we reached the top of the fixed lines, we came upon a party of two 
mountaineers who signaled to us that they needed assistance. We made a brief 
assessment, and it was clear they were not going to be able to descend the fixed 
lines without help. At this point, I activated the SOS feature on my Garmin 
inReach and began trying to communicate with rescuers while Heath, a trained 
Wilderness First Responder, assessed that one of the distressed mountaineers, 
Climber 1, was suffering from frostbite in his hands and potentially on his 
nose. He was nearly hypothermic. The other distressed mountaineer, Climber 
2, seemed fine physically, but mentally he seemed somewhat disconnected and 
potentially suffering from altitude sickness. He required instructions on how to
------------------------------
ALASKA    I    25   
complete basic tasks. We decided our priorities would be keeping Climber 1 as 
warm as possible, while keeping an eye on Climber 2 while we awaited assistance.
It was taking up to 15 minutes to send or receive each message on the inReach 
due to the weather and our location. We decided it might be faster to have Jacob 
descend to 14,200-foot camp and report directly to the rangers. We knew this 
decision was somewhat risky, as there is some crevasse hazard below the fixed 
lines. But we decided it was worthwhile since there was a well-established 
bootpack and we were familiar with the terrain. Additionally, from where we 
were positioned, we would be able to watch Jacob’s descent. 
While we waited for a rescue, we got out sleeping bags and parkas and bundled 
Heath and Climber 1 together to share warmth. As another party descending 
from 17,200-foot camp offered help, I saw a team of two climbers below, moving

Heath and Climber 1 together to share warmth. As another party descending 
from 17,200-foot camp offered help, I saw a team of two climbers below, moving 
towards the fixed lines. I thought this might be the rangers. Hoping to keep the 
scene clear, I suggested that the descending party continue going down; they left 
us with a bivy bag that we used to additionally shelter Climber 1.
After two hours, the wind shifted and we made the difficult decision to 
move Climber 1 up the hill to a more sheltered area. With an anchored belay, 
we essentially dragged him to the new location, a few hundred feet away. After 
approximately an hour, the two climbers I had seen ascending arrived at the top 
of the fixed lines. They were not the rangers, but one was a retired guide. He took 
the lead on the rescue.
As a group, we decided to lower Climber 1 down the fixed lines. We had a 60m 
half rope that we attached to his harness. I lowered Climber 1 down the fixed

As a group, we decided to lower Climber 1 down the fixed lines. We had a 60m 
half rope that we attached to his harness. I lowered Climber 1 down the fixed 
lines from above while others descended alongside. Getting him down the fixed 
lines took 60 to 90 minutes. As we were nearing the bottom, the initial ranger 
response arrived. The rangers took over, and Climber 1 was taken to the medical 
tent at 14,200-foot camp.
ANALYSIS
I believe my team made good choices throughout this rescue. We were quick to act 
and constantly reevaluated our decisions to fit the changing circumstances. We 
were lucky that Climber 1 was already in his harness, as getting him into it would 
have been difficult.
It would have been wise to have the descending party that left the bivy bag 
stay with us in case extra help was needed. At the time, we did not recognize that

feedback from NPS rangers about the incident. (Source: Jonathan Gopel.)

In the incident involving two stranded 
climbers near the top of the fixed lines at 
16,200 feet (see page 24), Jacob Dong, 
Jonathan Gopel, and Heath Himstedt 
rendered critical aid to fellow climbers who 
were facing a life-and-death emergency. 
For exemplary expedition behavior, 
these three along with teammate Amit 
Sule (who was in camp on the day of the 
rescue) were recognized with the Denali

Sam Hennessey, of Alpine Ascents 
Denali, and Michael Gardner, from 
the Alaska Mountaineering School, both 
worked with NPS rangers to transport 
rescue gear to the 16,200-foot ridge on 
Denali’s West Buttress. This was part of a

has fallen out of favor in recent years due to the increased popularity of more 
direct and technical lines to the summit, including Ham and Eggs and Shaken, 
Not Stirred. Throughout their trip, the climbers had been checking in daily with 
a friend. Their final communication was on May 5 and stated that they were 
departing on the climb.
Following the overdue notification on May 7, NPS personnel were able to 
conduct a helicopter reconnaissance. After locating the overdue climbers’ camp, 
the personnel onboard the aircraft were able to clearly identify and follow the 
climbers’ approach and ascent track up 
the West Ridge. 
The team had cached skis and other 
gear on the ridge at the point where 
the climbing became more technical 
and a transition to crampons was 
required. The final observed tracks

terrain is comprises 3,000 feet of 
complex and crevassed alpine features. 
Both aerial and ground searches 
continued for 12 days after the initial 
report. Unfortunately, these searches 
only yielded sightings of scattered 
gear. NPS personnel concluded the fall 
and the exposure were not survivable, 
and rescue efforts ultimately 
were terminated.
ANALYSIS
Many details surrounding this accident 
remain unknown. It is unclear whether 
the climbers were roped together or 
utilizing running protection. A small avalanche with significant exposure to steep 
terrain can have tragic consequences. This is true even in circumstances where

terrain can have tragic consequences. This is true even in circumstances where 
the slide originates in benign terrain. Even for a competent and experienced team 
such as these climbers, isolated pockets of wind slab or storm slab can be difficult to 
predict. Climbers must be attentive to the terrain they are traveling in as well as the 
consequences of falling into the terrain below. 
This incident also highlights the benefits of carrying and communicating 
via two-way satellite devices on climbing expeditions. This team had scheduled 
check-ins with a reliable friend. This strategy allowed for efficient notification of 
emergency personnel and led to a timely resolution of the incident. (Sources: Denali

KNEE STUCK IN CRACK 
Sedona, Queen Victoria Spire 
On January 8, Climber 1 (female 25) got her knee stuck in a wide crack on the 
Regular Route (3 pitches, 5.7) on Queen Victoria Spire in Sedona. Climber 1 was 
following four friends on her first outdoor climb when she attempted an “alpine 
knee” while pulling onto a ledge on the second pitch. An “alpine knee” is when 
you place that joint on top of a high hold and use it for progress, instead of a foot. 
Rather than helping her onto the ledge, Climber 1’s knee slipped into a four-inch-
wide crack, where it wedged and became stuck. Others in her party tried pouring 
water over her knee in an attempt to free it but were unsuccessful. 
At 5:15 p.m., the Coconino County Sheriff’s department was contacted to 
perform a rescue. By 8 p.m., the SAR team had arrived. It took over an hour to free

the climber from the crack, and by then the climber was exhibiting signs of mild 
hypothermia (they had started climbing at 12:30 p.m.). The climbing party was 
airlifted off the spire. The stuck climber was not injured and refused treatment.
ANALYSIS
The climbers in this scenario did “everything right,” according to the SAR team. 
They tried to free their partner, and when they couldn’t, they initiated a rescue. 
Many relatively easy routes have awkward sections or styles of climbing that 
may seem above the technical grade when first encountered outdoors. Care 
should be taken when making a move where a slip or fall could result in injury or 
entrapment. It took about four hours to free this climber, and temperatures at the 
crag dropped to around 30°F. Consider worst-case scenarios when preparing for a 
climb, as unexpected events could result in prolonged exposure to the elements.

UNROPED FALL | Loose Rock
Prescott, Granite Dells, Corndog Wall 
On September 17, my boyfriend, Adam, my son, Tyler, our friends Chase and 
Megan, and I, Melissa Wright, were climbing at the Corndog Wall. Adam was at 
the top of a route, giving a refresher to Megan on cleaning an anchor. I was at the 
bottom. We saw two climbers approach with a crash pad. To my knowledge, there 
were no bouldering routes on our wall, so our assumption was they would move 
on. The young men were part of a large group who attended nearby Embry-Riddle 
Aeronautical University. The rest of their group—at least eight more—were sport 
climbing nearby.
Adam saw one of the guys free solo up a 20-foot-high rock face to our right. The 
area where they were climbing had no established routes listed on Mountain Project.

As the guy started downclimbing, Adam yelled to him that there was an easy walk-
off. The young man said he was fine and that the walk-off was too far. 
Once the first guy was down, his friend “Bill,” began to climb. He also was 
unroped. “Bill” was wearing a bike helmet, and we later discovered this was roughly

screaming. “Bill” appeared to have been holding on to a large block that pulled out.
We called 911. I came up to the scene and saw “Bill” sitting upright. There was 
a large boulder sitting on the crash pad along with a scattering of smaller rocks. I 
saw blood on the wall, and I could see all the muscle and bone in his left calf. His 
right femur was broken, and he was missing most of the skin on the backside of his 
thigh. I ran to my pack and grabbed my first-aid kit and some clothing to treat the 
wounds, as it was obvious the gauze we had would not be enough. Adam made his 
way down, evaluated the scene, deemed it safe from further rockfall, put on gloves, 
and began applying pressure to “Bill’s” wounds.

ANALYSIS
Crowding, loose rock, unroped climbing on new terrain, inexperience—all these 
factors played into an accident that was easily avoidable. 
Wright also notes, “Their first-aid kits were inadequate and two of them offered 
tourniquets. They wanted to move ‘Bill’ into shade. Based on the severity of his 
injuries, moving him could have severed an artery. It’s one of the few times I didn’t 
have my Garmin. I never adventure without it now.” (Source: Melissa Wright.)

FALL ON ROCK | Broken Hold
Mendoza Canyon, Table Dome 
On February 24, Steve Sagin (58) and Jerry Cagle (70) were climbing Wily Javelina 
(6 pitches, 5.9 PG-13) on Table Dome in the remote Mendoza Canyon, southwest of 
Tucson. On pitch five, Sagin broke a hold and took a long leader fall. 
Cagle wrote to A NAC:
Wily Javelina is a coveted route and considered a bit of a testpiece. Though 
it’s frequently climbed using just the bolts, the distances between them are 
considerable; they can be supplemented with gear—albeit possibly dubious—so 
we also carried a light rack. We each carried cell phones, and I carried a Garmin 
inReach Mini. We had jackets, space blankets, food, water, and headlamps.
Reaching the start of the approach hike entails driving for 9.5 miles on an 
unmaintained dirt road. The approach wends through two miles of rugged trails.

The areas adjacent to the paths present an impenetrable barrier of catclaw acacias 
and thorny mesquite trees. 
It was around 10 a.m. when we started climbing. Steve led pitch one, with the 
first bolt 30 to 40 feet off the ground. We swung leads. Though I had always shied 
away from this route due to its reputation for serious runouts and sections of poor-
quality rock, neither of us was excessively nervous. But throughout the course of the 
climb, we repeated the mantra that “falling was not an option.” It is my considered 
opinion that this route is the textbook definition of an R-rated route and not PG-13 
(as graded on Mountain Project).
The rough approach to Table Dome played a factor in the call for rescue after Steve Sagin took a 
long leader fall on Wily Javelina. His partner, Jerry Cagle, wrote, “The topography is generally 
rugged and invariably involves some degree of bushwhacking.” Jerry Cagle

As Steve led pitch five, he passed the middle mark on the ropes (60m x 7.9mm 
twin/half ropes). He was well past the second bolt on the “chicken-head-studded” 
upper section, at the start of the easier climbing, when a large hold fractured, 
sending considerable debris past my helmet. He fell and struck a large ledge 30 or 40 
feet below him with the full force of his weight. The rope came taut as he started to 
slide off the ledge. It was immediately obvious that he was seriously injured. 
We determined that lowering him to my position at the anchor was our best 
option. We had enough rope to lower him to the stance with about ten feet to spare.
Steve was bleeding in several places but not excessively. His broken ankle was 
likely the most serious injury, and we determined it was not a compound [open]

likely the most serious injury, and we determined it was not a compound [open] 
fracture. We knew we couldn’t extricate ourselves from the canyon due to the 
difficult terrain, so I pulled out the inReach, only to discover the batteries were 
dead. We next dialed 911 on my cell phone. The battery was low, having recorded our 
approach using the Gaia GPS application. To our surprise, a voice came on the other 
end, asking, “What’s your emergency?” We explained our situation and indicated 
that we intended to rappel the route but would require assistance to evacuate.
We were starting the last rappel when we heard a helicopter approaching. A 
Pima County Sheriff’s Department officer was lowered, and he hooked Steve up 
to the rescue cable. They flew him to an ambulance, which took him to a hospital 
in Tucson. I was left to return on my own and was able to get back to the truck

X-rays taken at the hospital showed that Steve’s tibia was shattered into eight 
pieces. The fibula was, thankfully, not involved. This could have just as easily 
resulted in a fatality had he landed differently.
ANALYSIS
The duo was very experienced, having over 60 years of climbing between them. 
Sagin had climbed extensively in Mendoza Canyon, and this was his sixth time on 
Wily Javelina. Despite this, several factors contributed to an accident. 
Cagle wrote to A NAC, “Failure to place protection and test holds were the 
biggest factors contributing directly to the accident. That said, I have routinely 
climbed easy ground without stopping to place pro, and it’s not practical to test 
every hold on a route of that length.

“Several other failures that—but for luck—could have easily compounded the 
difficulty of our situation: 
1. I failed to make certain the battery on the inReach was charged. 
2. My cell phone battery wasn’t fully charged when we left that morning. I 
had intended to charge it on the ride but didn’t have a compatible cable. 
3. On the approach, I didn’t pay sufficient attention to our surroundings and 
let Steve lead the way while I chatted and followed blindly along. On the 
return, I depended heavily on the GPS track I had recorded on my phone. 
Had the phone failed, I am pretty sure I would’ve gotten lost and had to 
bivouac.
“As a result of this incident, I now strive when climbing or hiking to cultivate 
a mindset that assumes there will be an accident and to be fully prepared, both in 
skills and in resources.” (Source: Jerry Cagle.)

CALIFORNIA
 
SHASTA SEASON SUMMARY  
The 2023 climbing season kicked off in early April, after a robust winter that brought 
well above average snowfall. With a nearly 200-inch base at 7,000 feet, skiers and 
climbers were eager to get on the mountain. Strong north wind events throughout 
the winter had left north-facing climbing routes with a thin snowpack and generally 
thinner snowpack above treeline. 
In late June, the thin snowpack on the upper mountain began to melt and affect 
south-side climbing routes. Rockfall became the primary hazard for climbers, 
resulting in multiple accidents. In late July, climbing rangers began advising 
climbers not to climb Avalanche Gulch due to poor conditions. The remainder of the 
summer remained busy on east- and north-facing climbing routes. The Clear Creek 
Route on the mountain’s east side remains a popular alternative for mid- to late-
------------------------------
summer remained busy on east- and north-facing climbing routes. The Clear Creek 
Route on the mountain’s east side remains a popular alternative for mid- to late-
season climbing and for novice mountaineers; there is little to no rockfall due to its 
generally low angle. The route is not to be taken lightly, however, as we’ve had plenty 
of slips, trips, and falls on loose rock over the years, resulting in twisted and broken 
ankles. We’ve also had numerous exposure-related injuries from climbers becoming 
lost in poor weather. If you get off route, steep terrain does exist and slips/falls are 
not as friendly.
In 2023, we had ten SAR incidents on Mt. Shasta. This is about half of the average 
annual total of 20 incidents since 1992. The 2023 incidents consisted of one search, 
seven rescues, and two fatalities.

UNPLANNED BIVOUAC | Lost, Separated from Party
Mt. Shasta, Whitney Glacier 
In near whiteout conditions on the afternoon of May 5, Adam Danielson (51) of 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, separated from his party at the summit of Mt. Shasta at 2:45 
p.m. Though he and his party had climbed Avalanche Gulch—a route that ascends 
the south side of the mountain—Danielson mistakenly descended to the north onto 
the Whitney Glacier. The remainder of his party, who were on skis, safely descended 
to their previous night’s camp at Helen Lake. Danielson never arrived.
The weather during this period was winter-like, with rain, snow, wind, and 
very cold temperatures. Danielson didn’t have reliable navigation tools, nor 
overnight equipment. He was equipped with a small pack, water, a bit of food, an 
ice axe, crampons, a helmet, snowshoes, and a cell phone. Danielson realized he

ice axe, crampons, a helmet, snowshoes, and a cell phone. Danielson realized he 
was lost when he encountered glaciated terrain and large crevasses. He called 911 
and began direct communication with the 
Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office and USFS 
climbing ranger Nick Meyers. 
Cellular service was good at his location, 
and Danielson had an extra battery pack for 
his phone. Meyers told him that, regardless 
of any rescue plan, he was looking at an open 
overnight bivy. It would take rescuers four 
to six hours to get to his location by foot. 
Meyers suggested that Danielson descend 
if he could stay off the glacier, because a 
lower elevation would offer better protection 
from the weather. However, Danielson soon 
encountered a large crevasse and was afraid 
to move further. He was advised to shelter 
in place and that a rescue would launch in the 
morning.

At 5:30 a.m., continued poor weather prevented a helicopter rescue. Climbing 
rangers launched a ground rescue via the Northgate trailhead on snowmobile and 
skis. Siskiyou County SAR supported them with a snowcat and communications. 
Contact was made with Danielson at 12:30 p.m. at 11,600 feet on the Whitney 
Glacier. He was ambulatory, with a minor cold injury, and was escorted out to the 
Northgate trailhead by 4 p.m.; the sheriff’s office then transported him several miles 
via snowcat to parked vehicles.
ANALYSIS
Danielson was humble and appreciative of the rescue efforts. Here are some take-
home points: 
• Check the weather before you climb and monitor conditions as you climb. 
Flexibility is one of the most important mountain skills. Be willing to change plans.
• Check your summit fever at the door. Don’t summit late in the day.

• Don’t separate from your party. Make sure everyone is using the same mode of 
travel. In this case, Danielson was on foot and the rest of his party was on skis.
• Play the “what if” game: If things don’t go as planned, what are you going 
to do? Often incidents don’t involve injury but could involve environmental 
hazards like severe weather or an unplanned bivy. A small pad, bivy sack or 
tarp, and an extra down jacket can make a difference. (Source: Mt. Shasta

HYPOTHERMIA AND FROSTBITE | Summit Fever
Mt. Shasta, Avalanche Gulch 
A 54-year-old, solo male climber attempted a car-to-car climb of Mt. Shasta, 
starting at midnight on Friday, April 21. He carried a small pack and no overnight 
equipment. Two local climbers encountered the man high on the mountain on 
Saturday, April 22. One of the climbers reported to the Mt. Shasta climbing 
rangers that:

equipment. Two local climbers encountered the man high on the mountain on 
Saturday, April 22. One of the climbers reported to the Mt. Shasta climbing 
rangers that:
“He was moving so slowly, sometimes on his hands and knees. I asked him if he 
needed anything. I told him that he didn’t have to go up, but he certainly needed 
to go down. On my way back down from the summit, he was still only 50 or 60 
feet higher. I told him I was a mountain guide and that he should come down the 
mountain with me. He asked if I thought he could make it to the summit in an 
hour. I told him it would take him at least four hours, and he’d have to descend in 
the dark. He absolutely refused to turn around.”
At 4:15 a.m. on Sunday, April 23, Sam Kieckhefer, a guide, was ascending with 
a client...”when he encountered the distressed climber. He contacted the Siskiyou 
County Sheriff’s Office and USFS ranger Nick Meyers. The climber had been

County Sheriff’s Office and USFS ranger Nick Meyers. The climber had been 
descending and was at 9,200 feet. He was cold, disoriented, and mildly combative. 
He was wearing no shoes, socks, or gloves. His equipment was spread out on the 
slope. In an incident report submitted to the rangers, Kieckhefer wrote: 
“The climber was barefoot, feet white and bloody, toenails missing or lifted off 
the bed. He was holding his phone. Initially I asked him how I could help, and he 
said he didn’t need help. He believed he was at home and was looking for blankets 
because he was cold. He was insistent that he did not want us to help him and that 
he was fine. I would characterize the climber as severely disoriented and borderline 
combative. My biggest concern was him trying to move because the snow was 
extremely firm and he was positioned on a slope [creating a fall hazard].

“After notifying 911 of the nature of the emergency and our location, they 
asked we stay with the climber. I received a call from the Siskiyou County sheriff...
to tell me they were aware of our situation and were working on it.
“During/after these two calls, we gathered [the climber’s] boots, socks, gloves, 
and pack. He was more willing to accept help at this time. We immediately dug a flat 
platform for him to sit, helped him put his socks and boots on, got him in all of his 
layers and a few of ours. We also put him in an emergency bivy and gave him water 
and some food. In this process, we noticed he had a Jetboil and began boiling. After 
warming a bit, the climber’s awareness improved dramatically, and after about an 
hour he reported that he was feeling better but could not feel his feet.”

ANALYSIS
It almost goes without saying that pushing too hard on a mountain can be hazardous 
to the climber and to those who provide assistance. 
Kieckhefer reported that the climber had reached the top of the Red Banks 
(13,110 feet) at 2 p.m. and reported feeling quite exhausted. Because of the 
proximity to the summit, he decided to rest, eat, and drink and then push on. He 
began climbing Misery Hill (13,840 feet) at 3 p.m., and we estimate he summited 
around 5 p.m. From there, details are unclear, but he obviously became disoriented 
and hypothermic as he was descending. He was out through the night with no 
sleeping bag or tent. (Sources: Mt. Shasta Climbing Rangers and Sam Kieckhefer.)

Mt. Shasta, Clear Creek Route 
On June 16, Siskiyou County was notified of a missing climber on the Clear Creek 
Route of Mt. Shasta. The climber had been overdue for 30 hours, and loved ones had 
lost communication and called 911. Mt. Shasta climbing rangers mobilized to the 
trailhead to begin search efforts on snowmobiles and skis. A California Highway 
Patrol (CHP) helicopter was launched and was quickly able to spot a climber 
descending the mountain at around 10,000 feet. CHP made visual and verbal contact 
with the climber and positively identified him as the missing climber. The climber 
indicated that he did not want help. CHP and the climbing rangers stood down.
On June 18, two days later, climbing rangers were again notified by the Siskiyou 
County Sheriff’s Office that the same climber was still missing and had once again

stopped communication with family. Rangers mobilized to begin a search. Two 
climbing rangers launched from the Clear Creek trailhead on snowmobiles, while 
two other rangers prepared for a CHP helicopter insertion onto the upper mountain. 
Just then, the climber, who had emerged onto a road, was located a quarter mile from 
the trailhead. The climber was in good condition, and all staff returned home.
ANALYSIS
While 911 undeniably saves lives every year, it comes with disadvantages, 
including use of the service for non-emergency situations and, in this case, the 
issue of erroneous reporting. Even the best-intended false report can squander 
valuable rescuer time and resources and burden an overtaxed system. It might even 
impede a real emergency response. These 911 calls were placed by family members, 
never by the climber himself. In both instances, the climber was surprised to see

never by the climber himself. In both instances, the climber was surprised to see 
SAR members and was not in need of help. It is important that the climber keep 
their loved ones or emergency contact updated as necessary. The climber had been 
on the mountain for five or six days on a route that normally takes one to two days.

FATAL FALL DURING DESCENT 
Yosemite National Park, Tenaya Peak 
On July 21, Yosemite dispatch received an emergency alert from Tenaya Lake’s East 
Beach. Initial reports indicated that a climber in his 50s had taken a tumbling fall 
on Tenaya Peak and was not breathing. The first ranger arrived at the Tenaya East
------------------------------

Beach parking lot at 11:58 a.m. and made contact with the injured climber’s partner. 
The injured climber was reported to be both apneic (not breathing) and pulseless. 
The ranger and the injured climber’s partner began hiking toward the accident 
location. When the ranger arrived on scene, they assessed the patient and 
pronounced the climber’s death at 12:44 p.m. 
The ranger also documented all details of the scene. Another Yosemite ranger 
conducted a field interview with the climbing partner, during which it was revealed 
that the fatal fall occurred while descending from Tenaya Peak. The terrain consisted 
of low brush, loose sand, gravel, and boulders. The area included sections of 3rd- and 
4th-class terrain, as well as wet and slippery sections due to water and snow.

4th-class terrain, as well as wet and slippery sections due to water and snow.
The climbing partner had witnessed an earlier fall, when the climber slid several 
feet after loose dirt dislodged beneath him. Despite the partner’s effort to encourage 
the climber to move toward a more stable area, their descent path continued in this 
terrain. The deceased climber ultimately slid again and came to rest 200 to 250 feet 
below his climbing partner. After the fall, the climbing partner ran to Tenaya Lake to 
seek help, due to limited cell service on the mountain.
A ranger and a SAR technician remained with the deceased climber while the 
climbing partner and another ranger hiked back to Tenaya Lake. At 6:26 p.m., the 
park helicopter airlifted the climber’s remains via long-line for transport to the 
Crane Flat Helibase.

ANALYSIS
• Plan Your Descent: Before ascending any route, climbers should also plan the 
descent. The preferred descent route, the location of rappel anchors, and the 
ideal path back to the trailhead should all be identified.
• Stay Within Your Ability: Choose descents that match the skill level and 
experience of each climber on a team. If uncertain about a particular descent, 
seek guidance and information from experienced climbers.
• Weather Awareness: Climbers should monitor changing weather conditions, 
which can impact a descent, especially on exposed routes. Plans should always 
include emergency shelter and retreat options.
• Rescue and Communications: Teams should carry some means of reliable 
communication in the event of an emergency, such as a charged cell phone or 
a satellite communication device. Be aware of limited cell service in certain 
areas. (Source: Yosemite National Park Climbing Rangers.)

FATAL ROCKFALL 
Yosemite National Park, Leaning Tower 
On the afternoon of June 19, two teams were descending from Leaning Tower. The 
descent, which is known to be challenging, was the site of a devastating accident and 
a male climber in his 40s lost his life. 
While the lower team was trying to find an anchor, the climbing team above 
them began rappelling atop the same gully. One of the climbers in the second team 
was rappelling when they dislodged a four-foot by two-foot by six-inch rock. The 
climbers yelled, “Rock” as the block fell down the descent gully and began dislodging 
additional rocks and debris along the way.
------------------------------
CALIFORNIA    I    37   
The fixed haul line on which one member of the lower team was descending was 
severed by the rockfall approximately 50 feet below the anchor. The climber on the 
cut rope fell approximately 300 feet and died on impact. Both teams called 911 to 
report the accident as they continued descending to render aid.
ANALYSIS
This unfortunate incident highlights the risks inherent to descending, especially 
when traveling or rappelling through loose rock. The Leaning Tower rappels 
follow a notoriously loose gully and are especially dangerous. Climbers often focus 
heavily on managing risks during the ascent but should also dedicate the same 
meticulous attention to safety during descent. 
The Yosemite climbing rangers provided the following reminders for readers:

• Rappel Safet y. Climbers should exercise extreme caution during rappel 
descents, particularly in areas with loose rock. It’s imperative to be mindful of 
the potential for rockfall and to take precautions to minimize risk. 
• Helmet Use. Wearing a climbing helmet is of utmost importance, not only 
during the ascent but also during descent. A helmet can provide protection 
against falling debris and significantly reduce the risk of head injuries.
• Communication and Spacing. Climbing teams should communicate with 
other teams during rappel descents. Maintaining ample spacing between teams 
can mitigate accidental rockfall incidents. Though it is not always convenient, 
consider spending additional time before beginning a descent to allow adequate 
spacing between parties. 
• Rope Management. Proper rope management is essential to avoid 
entanglements and ensure ropes do not dislodge debris during rope retrieval. 
Consider rappelling with ropes connected to a climbing harness; the
------------------------------
entanglements and ensure ropes do not dislodge debris during rope retrieval. 
Consider rappelling with ropes connected to a climbing harness; the 
“saddlebag” technique minimizes the risk of rope tails dislodging debris.
• Route Assessment. Prior to descent, climbers should assess the route for 
potential hazards, such as loose rock and other dangers. Research online updates 
and information. This evaluation can inform decision-making and tactics.
• Community Impact. This incident is a somber reminder of the collective 
responsibility within our community to prioritize safety, communicate openly, 
and adhere to best practices. Climbers should remain vigilant, respect risks, 
and continually work to minimize accident potential. The loss of a climber’s 
life underscores the need for a shared commitment to safety and preparedness. 
As a reminder, the climbing community has resources, like the Climbing Grief 
Fund, for those experiencing hardship secondary to a climbing-related accident.

LEADER FALL | Inadequate Protection
Yosemite National Park, Half Dome 
On July 7, two male climbers in their 30s began a proposed three-day climb of Half 
Dome’s Regular Northwest Face (VI 5.9 C1). Their plan was to fix the initial three 
pitches on the first day, climb to the Big Sandy ledge the following day, and then 
summit on the third day. 
The climb was unfolding well until they arrived at pitch eight, the start of a long
------------------------------

traverse up and right. The leader 
encountered difficult route-finding 
on chossy but easy terrain. He began 
to wonder if he was off route, as rock 
quality began to deteriorate and signs 
of wear from past climbers became 
less obvious. Nevertheless, the leader 
continued climbing in hopes of 
getting back on route.
Due to the wandering nature 
of the pitch, this climber decided 
to remove a previous piece of 
protection to prevent rope drag. The 
climber placed a 0.3 cam in what 
appeared to be solid rock, planning 
to lower off this new piece in order 
to clean the previous cam. When 
the climber weighted the 0.3 cam, the surrounding rock broke, causing a 40-to-50-
foot tumbling fall. Several other pieces of protection pulled, contributing to the 
substantial fall.
After being caught by the rope, the fallen climber realized he had sustained several

foot tumbling fall. Several other pieces of protection pulled, contributing to the

After being caught by the rope, the fallen climber realized he had sustained several 
injuries, causing an unusable foot and back mobility issues. He had several abrasions. 
This climber also realized that the gear loop containing his anchor-building materials 
and belay device had been torn off. A short time later, the team called NPS personnel 
for rescue assistance and began a tedious rappel toward the ground.
The team was able to self-rescue to the ground. Fortunately, another team had 
fixed the first three pitches, making for easier rappels. At the base, the climbers were 
met by two NPS climbing rangers on a Half Dome patrol. The rangers assessed the 
injured climber and decided it was appropriate to extract the patient via helicopter.

Two additional NPS rescuers were inserted into the scene with a litter. The patient 
was packaged and extracted via short-haul. The patient’s partner spent the night at 
the base of the route and hiked out the following day.
ANALYSIS
The Yosemite climbing rangers remind readers of the following safety measures 
pertinent to this incident: 
• Do not underestimate easy terrain. It is common for experienced and 
inexperienced climbers to get injured or killed in easy terrain. Letting one’s guard 
down increases the likelihood of an accident. Regardless of the relative difficulty, 
continue to be mindful and situationally aware.  
The climber who fell, later said: “If this fall had happened on steeper or 
harder terrain, the consequences would have been minor. The terrain that I often 
consider easy or safe is actually the most unstable and consequential.”
------------------------------
harder terrain, the consequences would have been minor. The terrain that I often 
consider easy or safe is actually the most unstable and consequential.”
• Contact rescue personnel ASAP. Organizing a rescue is often time-consuming. 
The rangers recommend contacting rescue personnel as soon as it is evident 
that outside resources are needed. In this instance, the injured climber’s partner

contacted YOSAR first thing, even though rescue was not immediately needed. 
This allowed SAR additional time to plan and launch the helicopter prior to 
sunset, thus retrieving the injured climber on the same day.
• Maximize route familiarization. Climbers should carefully study climbing and 
descent routes ahead of time. This information can be gleaned from topos and by 
seeking beta from experienced climbers. These efforts can enhance route-finding 
and overall safety by helping to prevent diversions onto unstable terrain. (Source:

ROCKFALL | Large Flake Detached on Follower
Yosemite National Park, Yosemite Falls Wall

Falls Wall. Via Aqua is an adventurous and lesser-known classic four-pitch 5.8 
climb. The climbers were progressing up the wall when disaster struck. While one 
climber was following an angled flake feature on pitch three, a sizable section of 
the flake detached from the wall, impacted the climber’s left shoulder, and tore off 
a portion of his left ear. Luckily, the rope was not severed by the flake and caught 
his fall. 
After his fall, and despite his injuries, the climber was able to climb 15 to 20 
feet up to his partner’s stance. The team called 911 for a rescue. They noted that 
the injured climber was “covered in blood” that originated from a five-inch-long 
laceration on his shoulder. The tissue was exposed down to the muscle, and the 
bleeding from this wound was life-threatening.   
Recognizing the urgency of rescue, NPS personnel conducted a timely short-haul

Recognizing the urgency of rescue, NPS personnel conducted a timely short-haul 
operation from the climbers’ small belay ledge. Once on the ground, the climber was 
transferred to an ambulance for transport to definitive care at a local hospital. 
ANALYSIS
This incident highlights a few considerations for climbers in Yosemite: 
• Impacts of Freeze-Thaw Cycles. The historic snowfall during the winter 
of 2022-2023, followed by spring freeze/thaw cycles, caused much of the 
granite in the park to expand and contract. This phenomenon caused rock to 
detach from various walls and pose risks to climbers. Climbers are advised 
to consider previous environmental conditions and those impacts on their 
chosen routes. 
• Medical Training and Equipment. Carrying first aid on a climb is highly 
recommended. Useful items include medical tape, gauze, pain medication, 
and material to create a sling and swath. These items can be improvised out of

recommended. Useful items include medical tape, gauze, pain medication, 
and material to create a sling and swath. These items can be improvised out of 
clothing and climbing equipment. This injured climber was remarkably lucky. 
If the falling flake had cut the interior of his arm (brachial artery), it could 
have been lethal. Knowing how to apply direct pressure to a bleed and create 
a tourniquet could be a lifesaver. Having medical tools and training should be 
expected of all climbing partners.  
• Self-Rescue Proficiency. The incident highlighted the importance of 
maintaining self-rescue skills. Baseline skills include safe ascent and descent of 
ropes, escape from belay systems, and improvising emergency solutions. While

SAR can provide assistance, the climbing team itself is best able to address 
urgent situations. Self-rescue skills should be a priority for climbers of all 
levels. (Source: Yosemite National Park Climbing Rangers.)
FATAL UNROPED FALL 
Yosemite National Park, El Capitan
On October 2, a 55-year-old male was reported missing by his son. The missing 
climber had failed to return from a solo attempt on the West Gully of El Capitan. 
Members of Yosemite Search and Rescue (YOSAR) were deployed, and after a few 
hours of searching, the body of the missing climber was located near the base of 
the gully. He had sustained fatal injuries. 
The West Gully is a historic route dating back to 1905. Of note, one of the first 
ascensionists also took a fatal fall. The route has an easy technical grade (5.5) 
but is notorious for loose rock and difficult route-finding. Many climbers and

ascensionists also took a fatal fall. The route has an easy technical grade (5.5) 
but is notorious for loose rock and difficult route-finding. Many climbers and 
hikers underestimate the complexities of this climb when seeking a route to the 
summit of El Capitan. 
The terrain in the West Gully is steep, rocky, and vegetated. Ultimately, the team 
decided that lowering systems and guiding lines would expose personnel to the least 
hazard. Multiple hours were required for rigging and recovery. 
The cause of death was cranial trauma secondary to either a fall or being struck 
by a falling rock. The exact sequence of events leading to the fall remains unclear, 
but it is likely that the climber slipped, broke a hold, or fell while climbing off route.

CALIFORNIA    I    41   
ANALYSIS
Contributing factors in this incident included:
• Lack of Protective Equipment. The climber was not wearing a helmet, which 
could have mitigated or prevented the fatal head injury. 
• Terrain Challenges. El Capitan’s West Gully has 4th- and 5th-class terrain. This 
terrain may have exceeded the skill level of the deceased climber. 
• Solo Climbing. Embarking on any climb without a partner reduces one’s ability 
to receive immediate aid or outside assistance in the event of an accident. 
• Route Information. Despite its being a technical climbing route, West Gully 
route information is shared on numerous hiking apps and websites. When 
researching a technical climb, it is best to gather information from fellow 
climbers and climbing-specific resources. (Source: Yosemite National Park

IMPALEMENT ON CAM 
Yosemite National Park, El Capitan
On October 20, Gabe Hayden, Dylan Miller, and I were climbing the Freeblast (10 
pitches, 5.11) on our way to attempt The Shield (VI 5.8 A3) on El Cap. My partners both 
had experience on the Freeblast, and they led us through the harder pitches, pulling on 
gear when necessary to keep up our pace and navigate around other parties. 
I got the last, easier block. Having 
spent the preceding months on a 
commercial fishing boat, I had very little 
climbing fitness. Nonetheless, there is 
only one opportunity to onsight, and 
I assumed I could manage the pitches. 
Pulling into the Half Dollar flake (5.10), 
I made a rookie mistake and placed a 
cam in the only available finger lock. 
I decided I could work around it and, 
spying some faint chalk on the arête, I 
thought I’d outsmart the section with 
a few moves of face climbing. I did not 
find the jugs I had hoped for, and soon I

I groped upward, hoping to climb 
my way out of the pickle, but soon fell. 
Because I had ventured onto the arête, I 
fell from an awkward, stemmed-out position and smacked hard onto the slab. I then 
slid several feet until the rope caught. Ouch! 
I shook it off and finished the pitch, but I had a lingering charley horse. I carried 
on through the last pitch, but by the time I reached Mammoth Terrace, I noticed 
blood on my leg and knew the injury was worse than a charley horse. It seemed I’d 
fallen onto one of my cams and it had cut my leg. When my partners arrived, I took 
off my harness, pulled down my pants, and rolled away so they could see the wound.

Still mobile, I took the portaledge and headed down the fixed ropes, leaving 
Dylan and Gabe to dump all of our precious water and wrestle the pigs down. I 
borrowed Dylan’s car and drove myself to the Valley medical clinic at about 3 p.m. 
There, I learned they close at 1 p.m. on Fridays and stay closed all weekend. I was 
lucky to find a nurse on-site, and he gave me some saline and gauze and sent me on 
my way. 
Back at El Cap Meadow, my partners helped me irrigate and bandage the wound, 
then drove me to urgent care in Oakhurst, where I got seven stitches. The next 
afternoon, I thumbed through the rack, wondering which cam had punctured me.

This was not a serious injury, but it was seriously novel. I would put it on a list of 
things you would rather not know: You can be impaled by the cams hanging on your 
harness. Is there a valuable takeaway from this incident? I think Gabe said it best:

PINNED UNDER BOULDER 
Inyo National Forest, Lamarck Col
Around 12:40 p.m. on September 28, Larsen Tormey (28) was pinned under a large 
boulder while hiking out after an attempt on the Evolution Traverse (IV 5.9). His 
climbing partner, Jacob Ireland (35), was able to free him after several hours, prior to 
the arrival of SAR.

Ireland wrote to A NAC:
The accident took place five miles from the trailhead. Lars was hiking ahead of 
me. I was at the top of Lamarck Col when I heard someone yelling. I figured this was 
Lars, but I couldn’t spot him. As I headed toward the sound the cries grew louder, 
and I knew that an accident had occurred. When I was directly above his voice, I 
could hear clearly, “I’m stuck! There’s a rock on me! Please help!”
I hit the SOS button on my Garmin inReach and started down the broken 4th-
class terrain. When I made it to Lars, he explained that, because he carried no 
traction devices nor ice axe, he had been downclimbing through a small tunnel or 
cave in the rock to avoid a steep section of hard-packed snow. A boulder the size of a 
city trash can he had been using as a hold came free. The rock was angled and sharp 
and plugged the slot so his leg was pinned just below his groin.

city trash can he had been using as a hold came free. The rock was angled and sharp 
and plugged the slot so his leg was pinned just below his groin.
The boulder was in the way, so I couldn’t see his injuries and had to rely on what 
he told me. From what I could tell, one leg was pinned near his groin. It’s hard to 
recall, but the rock was maybe three feet by three feet and one foot wide. 
There was no blood, but Lars believed he was bleeding internally and could not 
feel his leg. He was lying partly on the ice and was cold and shaking. I did my best 
to drape a puffy over him. I tried to move the boulder, but this only made him 
scream. The back of the rock was the obvious place to try moving it, but I quickly 
realized it wasn’t going to move by hand. I told Lars I was going to try the climbing

rope and gear we had brought.
He pleaded with me to just try by hand again, and I did my best to assure him that 
the rope would be better. I frantically unpacked my gear. I jammed a cam into a crack 
above us, wrapped the rope around the front of the boulder, and set up a hauling 
system with my harness and two Micro Traxions. 
The next hour was a blur. We tried multiple configurations of the rope and 
hauling methods. Nothing worked beyond a small amount of movement. One 
method from the side caused Lars to cry out, “Stop! You’re making it worse!” 
Between all my attempts, poor Lars begged me to keep trying. Every now and then 
we made eye contact, and I could see his horror and pain. I’d exhausted myself and 
started needing longer breaks between tries. My hand was bleeding, so I wrapped it 
with climbing tape. I had to cut the rope multiple times to quickly fix jams when I’d 
reset a system. Everything was failing.

I realized my phone had been getting messages. I had cell service and called 
911 and relayed information. Lars was screaming at me to keep trying. He didn’t 
believe help was going to come fast enough. Part of me believed him, so I did my 
best to talk on the phone and work on the boulder at the same time. Someone from 
the Inyo SAR team called back and I sent them photos and exact coordinates. They 
assured me they were on the way. 
It had been almost three hours since the boulder fell on Lars, and I was 
beginning to lose hope. Every failed attempt was devastating. I felt weak and 
my hips were raw and bruised from the harness. Then, in one adrenaline-fueled 
attempt, I clipped my harness directly to the rope around the boulder via a sling

and pulled to the side. The boulder started to move. My foot gained a bit of new 
leverage and the boulder moved more. Lars began yelling that he was able to move. 
“Keep going!” I found a hold in the back of the wall and pulled as hard as I could, 
screaming from the adrenaline and pain in my waist. 
Lars slipped down and behind the boulder to a larger ledge below. He was free 
and I was ecstatic. I used the rope to swing down to him. He was shaking, cold, and 
couldn’t feel his leg. I got him flat and bundled up with both sleeping bags and an 
air mattress under his body. He was in and out of consciousness, but his breathing 
remained stable. I checked his wound, and to my astonishment it didn’t look worse

An hour and a half later, a helicopter appeared and I felt massive relief. The U.S. 
Army had been flying training missions in the area, and the SAR team was able to 
use their Chinook helicopter to reach us. They landed at the bottom of the snowfield. 
An hour later Lars was in the chopper heading for Fresno. He suffered abrasions, 
major impact trauma, nerve damage, and internal bleeding. He still has trouble 
making large upward steps, but he is out hiking, biking, and getting back to normal.
ANALYSIS
I think the main factors in this accident were:
1. Lack of gear for snow travel: We should have had Microspikes or crampons 
and an ice axe. With those items, we would have directly descended the snow in 
Lamarck Col and avoided the loose rock.
2. Getting separated: With our technical objective behind us, we became

2. Getting separated: With our technical objective behind us, we became

least been able to help each other sooner. Lars spent almost an hour under the 
boulder before I found him. Had he been unconscious, I might have passed by and 
not realized he was missing until hours later.
3. More knowledge of hauling systems and pulleys: I tried a number of 
techniques with the climbing gear on hand. A few of these systems moved the 
boulder, but not enough to free Lars. If I had more knowledge, I could have rigged 
something to free him faster. (Source: Jacob Ireland.)
TOP-ROPE SOLO FALL | Device Jammed by Sling
Sequoia National Park, Angel Wings
On October 8, Whitney Clark was ascending a fixed rope at the start of Valkyrie (17 
pitches, 5.11+) when her single ascension device was jammed by a sling. She fell 30 
feet to the ground.

Clark wrote to A NAC:
“We woke at around 6 a.m. and made our way to the fixed line from the day 
before. The days were short, and we had many pitches to do. My partner, Luka 
Krajnc, went first, using a Grigri to jug and then transitioning to climbing. About 40 
feet up, he clove-hitched the rope to a bolt. I then started jugging with a single Micro 
Traxion. Thirty feet up, I leaned back on the rope. My body weight wasn’t supported 
because the sling around my neck [part of the top-rope solo setup] got sucked into 
the device and caught in the teeth of the Traxion. The rope was sliding against the 
sling. I hadn’t tied a backup knot.”
------------------------------
CALIFORNIA    I    45   
Clark attempted to wrap the rope around her leg. But her rope was new, thin, and 
slippery. She wrote, “I grabbed the rope and slowly started sliding down. Eventually 
the rope burn was too painful and I let go. I hit the ground, landed on my feet, and 
fell backward. I struck my lower back and then my head. I was wearing a helmet. 
Because the ground was angled, some of the force was dissipated, though I landed six 
inches from a large rock spike.
“I never lost consciousness, but was in a bit of shock. Luka rappelled down and 
did a spinal exam. He got me comfortable, and I sat there for a while. I had pain 
in my back and my left ankle. I used my inReach to call for a rescue while Luka 
retrieved our stuff. I started crawling and butt-scooting to where a heli could reach

ANALYSIS
Solo top-roping is integral to many forms of modern climbing. It allows a climber to 
self-belay when no partner is available, for a team to work on individual sections of a 
route without the need for a belayer, or for two climbers to move simultaneously, as 
in this situation. The errors Clark made were using only one device to safeguard her 
progress and not tying a backup knot.
“I was jugging by pulling on the rope, syncing up the slack, and sitting back,” 
Clark said. “The route was meandering, and the fixed line didn’t allow me to readily 
climb, so I decided to jug straight up the initial blank slab. The sling around my neck

climb, so I decided to jug straight up the initial blank slab. The sling around my neck 
was going to hold the Traxion upright [allowing the rope to feed freely] once I started

some point, but I will definitely use two devices. This was the first time I only used a 
single progress-capture device.” (Source: Whitney Clark.)
Whitney Clark’s progress-capture device failed when the as-yet-unused retention sling got stuck 
in the device as she was ascending. It is common practice to use a sling and an elastic connection 
to hold the progress-capture device upright as one climbs along a fixed rope. Luka Krajnc

FALL ON ROCK | Communication Error, Taken Off Belay
Malibu, Point Dume State Park
On October 9, we decided to go to the beachside cliff at Point Dume because my 
partner (female, 24) had never been and I, Ben Nutter (26), used to love to rope-solo 
there. We walked to the top, set up the anchors for the top-rope, and then rappelled 
down. The anchor was a quad sling on two bolts. I went first. I believe the route was 
Right Center (5.7). I climbed to the top and did what I normally do when I get to the 
top of a climb. I leaned back into my 
harness and onto the rope, then I fell all 
the way to the bottom.
I landed on the sand near my 
partner. Someone nearby had seen the 
fall and called 911. A lifeguard came 
over and stayed until a helicopter came 
to take me to an intensive-care unit. I 
am alive and can walk, but I suffered a

BOULDERING FALL | Insufficient Pads
Joshua Tree National Park, Hidden Valley Area
On November 9, Gibson McGee (19) was bouldering on White Rastafarian, a V2 
highball (some say V3) that has been the scene of many accidents. He fell from 
near the top and struck the ground, shattering his L1 vertebra (the highest bone 
in the lower back). 
Though Mountain Project describes White Rastafarian as “one of JTree’s finest

problems,” the climb is 25 feet tall—more like a short route instead of a boulder 
problem. After the midpoint crux, the climber is faced with a tricky mantel top-out. 
McGee wrote to A NAC, “I was heading to Joshua Tree for the weekend, and 
I was planning on meeting a group who were coming in the following morning. 
After setting up camp, I went to go climb the nearby White Rastafarian. I had 
previously attempted it but fell at the crux [15 feet off ground]. I was fine with no 
injuries.” McGee laid out three crash pads, set up a video camera to record himself, 
and started up the route.
“I got to the top of the route [about 25 feet off ground] and was too pumped to do 
the ‘easy’ mantel onto the top of the rock. I looked down and decided I could drop 
safely. I dropped, but when I hit the ground, I ended up shattering my L1 vertebra.

As of November 2023, McGee was recovering. He wrote, “While I am eager to 
be able to climb again, healing physically and mentally will take quite some time. I 
was very fortunate, looking back on the possible injuries I could’ve sustained.”
ANALYSIS
Bouldering is inherently dangerous, and highball problems particularly so. On 
Reddit, “un poco lobo” posted, “Was chatting with a park ranger who said they 
see more accidents on WR [White Rastafarian] than pretty much all other routes/
problems combined.”
McGee had been climbing outdoors consistently for the year prior. He wrote, 
“I saw White Rastafarian the first week I started climbing. It has always been a

“I saw White Rastafarian the first week I started climbing. It has always been a 
dream for me to do it.” His pad placements were correct, and he landed cleanly—no 
part of his body struck exposed ground. While multiple pads are a great idea, an 
evenly distributed second layer of pads might have saved McGee from a trip to 
the hospital. Covering gaps between pads with a thin “slider” pad also would have 
provided additional safety. McGee mentioned, “I should’ve brought a buddy and 
stacked bouldering pads.” 
For highballs, spotters need to be careful (and may even be extraneous), as 
the impact forces of a falling climber can be equally harmful to the spotter. While 
spotting highballs is more art than science, the general rule is to ensure that 
the falling climber stays on the pad after impact. (Guaranteeing that the climber 
impacts the pad itself is part of good pad placement.) A spotter should also protect

the falling climber stays on the pad after impact. (Guaranteeing that the climber 
impacts the pad itself is part of good pad placement.) A spotter should also protect 
the climber’s head and neck from impacting bare ground or surrounding obstacles. 
Another good rule to follow is to never fall above the 20-foot mark. Be open to 
using a top-rope to practice the problem. The great John Gill himself was a big 
exponent of top-roping.
Finally, Joshua Tree has a well-earned reputation for tricky climbing with a 
long learning curve. Different climbing areas have special characteristics that a 
grade does not necessarily convey. It’s a good idea to be conservative as you learn 
the peculiarities of an area. Said McGee, “I have bouldered in Joshua Tree four or 
five times. The grading is much, much harder than what you might think. I let the 
number [V2] get in my head rather than trusting the true difficulty of J-Tree grades.”

FREE SOLOIST RESCUE 
El Cajon Mountain, The Wedge
On February 12, Brent Donovan and Chase Morgan were hiking to El Cajon 
Mountain (ECM), east of San Diego, for a day of rock climbing. They were 
interrupted when they saw a free soloist stranded on the first pitch of Leonids. Free 
soloist Nathaniel Takatsuno fell from Leonids (3 pitches, 5.9) several months prior, 
on December 4, 2022.
Morgan wrote to A NAC:

a person was hanging out five bolts up, trying to get it together to pull the slippery 
layback move. We both joked about having been in that spot more than once. Despite 
being an “easy” route, that move never feels secure. 
Farther up the trail, the person came back into view, and he was still in the same 
spot. We figured it was a newer climber struggling on the move. When we got to the 
base around 8:30 or 8:45 a.m., the climber had been stuck for at least one hour. By 
the time we realized he was unroped, he was yelling for help. 
He told us he couldn’t downclimb the 45 feet below because he was “definitely 
going to fall” if he tried. He also said he thought if he had soloed the route, he 
could downclimb to the right (the actual 4th-class downclimb is to the left—to 
the right involves pitches up to 5.10). I told him to sit tight. He mentioned having

a harness and quickdraws in his bag at the base of the cliff, but no rope. It was 
unclear what his plan was with the gear, but it made the rescue easier. I would put 
him at college age, late teens to early 20s.
I grabbed his harness and some of his draws and led up to him on my rope. I 
clipped a draw to the bolt that was shoulder level with him (the fifth bolt, about 45 
feet up) and tied a quad-length sling around his waist. I secured the sling to my belay 
loop with a locker, while he slipped on his harness. The stance was uncomfortable 
(his calves were probably on fire at this point), but good enough for him to go hands-
free. After he was harnessed up, I attached his belay loop to my belay loop with a 
sling and a locker. I had Brent take tight on the rope and lower us both. I then went

ANALYSIS
El Cajon Mountain is a bad place to solo. Few routes have a walk-off, and the 
climbing is often thin face on brittle holds. We tried to get as much of the story 
as we could from him, but he was reluctant to share details and seemed quite 
embarrassed. He took off down the trail almost immediately after we got him to 
the ground, even though we told him that if he waited 15 minutes we could get 
his quickdraws for him. We learned he had never climbed at ECM before (possibly 
never outside a gym) and was completely unaware that a 22-year-old [Takatsuno] 
had died on the same route only two months prior. 
His harness and shoes were almost brand-new, and his quickdraws still

CALIFORNIA    I    49   
had price tags on them. There seemed to be complete lack of awareness of the 
limitations of his ability and of the terrain he was entering. I can only speculate 
why he chose to solo. He looked to be in pretty good shape, so my guess is that he 
climbs pretty hard in the gym and felt that 5.9 would be easy. He expressed that it 
was a stupid decision and that he would never do it again.
While I hate to see people get themselves into these situations, I would hate 
even more to find his mangled body on the ground. I’m glad he waited for people 
to show up instead of getting himself hurt—although he probably would have 
downclimbed just fine. San Diego has seen a disproportionate share of free solo 
fatalities recently, between the two ECM deaths* and Mike Spitz’s fall off Illusion 
Dweller in Joshua Tree (see ANAC 2023). I’ll take an embarrassed soloist over a 
fatality any day. (Sources: Chase Morgan and Brent Donovan.)

LEDGE FALL | Foothold Broke, Protection Pulled Out 
Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Long Draw 
Around 7:30 a.m. on September 11, Becca Steinbrecher (30) took a serious leader fall on 
Great White Wall (1,300 feet, 5.10d), below the North Rim in the Black Canyon. She fell 
at the beginning of pitch four on a relatively easy pegmatite ramp (5.8), 300 feet above 
the ground. As she started up from the belay on a sloping, broken terrace, protection 
was sparse. She ventured off route in search of gear. After placing a number 2 Metolius 
TCU, she made her way back to the pegmatite ramp. As she attempted a mantel, a 
foothold broke. The rock around the TCU fractured, and the protection pulled. Becca 
fell 30 feet to the terraced ledge and was knocked unconscious. 
Her climbing partner, Skyeler Congdon (40), did not move her because he was 
concerned about a spinal cord injury. “There’s like no good answer for that situation,”

Her climbing partner, Skyeler Congdon (40), did not move her because he was

hour, he decided to secure Becca to an anchor, rappel the route, and retrace the team’s 
approach up the Long Draw (gully). From there, he planned to seek help at the North 
Rim ranger station. The station was about an hour’s hike from the base of the route.
When Congdon arrived, there was no one at the ranger station. He then drove

his car to get cell reception up the road. He called 911 and eventually his report was 
forwarded to Black Canyon ranger Ryan Rees, who began preparations for the rescue 
and passed Incident Command to district ranger Ryan Thrush. They rounded up a SAR 
team that eventually numbered 28 personnel and secured a helicopter from the Army 
National Guard High-Altitude Aviation Training Site (HAATS) at Eagle, Colorado.
By 1:20 p.m., the SAR team had assembled at the ranger station. Becca had been on 
the pitch-four ledge for over five hours. It was unknown if she was still alive. 
Vic Zeilman, a former NPS climbing ranger and Black Canyon guidebook author, 
was a SAR volunteer on that day. He wrote to A NAC: “I would describe the rescue as 
being multifaceted, time sensitive, and complex, with a lot of unknowns right out of

being multifaceted, time sensitive, and complex, with a lot of unknowns right out of 
the gate. For that reason, we had a Plan A and Plan B happening simultaneously. Plan 
A was to utilize aviation resources if it was possible to either short-haul or hoist Becca. 
Plan B was to lower an attendant from the rim to near the base of the Great White Wall 
so that Becca could be raised back to the rim.” 
Both plans required that SAR personnel descend into the canyon, climb to Becca, 
and then lower her to the base of the climb. From there, she could be lowered down-
gully to a more open area near the bottom of the canyon and airlifted (Plan A) or 
delivered to a team to be raised 1,300 feet to the rim (Plan B). 
A climbing team including Zeilman, and led by NPS ranger Philippe Wheelock, 
departed at 1:45 p.m. They descended Long Draw and climbed to Becca. They radioed 
climbing NPS ranger Tom Schaefer—who was manning operations on the canyon 
rim—that Becca was unconscious but alive.

It was 4 p.m., and it would take over an hour for the HAATS helicopter to arrive. With 
sunset at 7:30 p.m., there was an ever-narrowing window for aerial extraction, as HAATS 
would not fly into the canyon in the dark. In the meantime, Schaefer had organized Plan 
B. This contingency required two rescue teams—one to rig the immense litter raise and 
another team to help transport the patient to the raise location. 
Around 5:15 p.m., the climbing team lowered Becca to the base of the route. When 
the helicopter arrived and landed on the rim, Schaefer considered two options: either 
lower Becca down 600 feet of steep gully for the helicopter evacuation or move her 200 
feet up to where she could be raised.

It had been almost 11 hours since Becca’s fall, and the helicopter was the fastest 
option to get her to critical care. The risk lay in any unforeseeable delay in getting her 
from the climb’s base to the bottom of the canyon. If they took too long, they would 
need to backtrack, do the Plan B litter raise, carry Becca to an ambulance, drive to 
Montrose, and so on. The decision was made to lower Becca. It was a tense race against 
time. The veteran climbing/SAR team had less than an hour to complete a complex 
600-foot lower that involved the time-consuming task of passing two knots. 
They made it with little time to spare. Just after 7 p.m., the HAATS helicopter flew 
in, lowered the hoist, and departed with the injured climber.

From the Montrose airport, the injured climber was transferred to St. Mary’s

Ashton Johnston, A NAC’s Western Slope editor, said, “Becca relayed to me that she

ANALYSIS
Former ranger and guidebook author Vic Zeilman wrote: “The items in Becca’s 
pack showed that they were properly prepared for a long climb in the Black Canyon: 
clothing, food, water, headlamps, etc. They carried radios with them. Skyeler left one 
radio with Becca and brought the other with him to the rim. Although it ultimately 
didn’t matter because she was unconscious, it could have played an important role.
“One item that could have been very beneficial would have been a SPOT device 
or something similar. There is no cell phone service in the Black Canyon (or even 
at most places on the North Rim), so response time can be delayed because the

Becca wrote to A NAC about the lessons she learned:
• Always do multi-pitch with a satellite device that texts (calls are spotty in the 
Black) to speed up rescue time. 
• Fund and support SAR.
• Wear a helmet. Mine saved my life. 
• Learn self-rescue skills. Do refreshers and know the local SAR contact wherever 
you go.  
• The Black is chossy. This route has many reports of loose rock. Climbing is 
dangerous, rock breaks sometimes. (Sources: Tom Schaefer, Vic Zeilman, Climbing

LEADER FALL ON ROCK | Off Route, Loose Rock, Protection Pulled 
Glenwood Canyon, Grizzly Creek Wall 
On November 11, Cory Jones and I, Max Conway (23), went to climb Mudflap Girl (10 
pitches, 5.10+) on the Grizzly Creek Wall (a.k.a. Mudwall). We knew it was to be a 
chossy climb that entices the adventure seeker. 
The approach was not straightforward, and we began climbing around 10 a.m., 
a bit later than we had wanted. Cory is much stronger than I am, so we planned to 
break up the pitches accordingly. The first pitch was mine, and Cory had the next 
three. Soon, it was my turn to lead the fifth pitch.
The belay was a large ledge with two bolts. Mountain Project said, “Angle up 
and right to two bolts on the face then trend left to the belay.” We could not see the 
bolts. About ten feet off the belay, I placed a 0.4 Friend, which I felt was solid. A bit

later, I placed a number 2 Friend that did not feel great. It was in a horizontal crack 
and slightly over-cammed in poor rock. The climbing was 5.9, so I felt relatively 
confident. I remember yelling down to Cory, “I should find more pro, but we’re 
burning daylight!” Since Mountain Project mentioned two bolts in my near future, 
I figured it wouldn’t be long before I was safe. 
I didn’t find the bolts. Before I knew it, something broke. I vaguely remember it 
being a handhold, but I am not certain. I had climbed about five to ten feet above 
the number 2 Friend. Unfortunately, it failed and I fell 30 feet. I decked on the belay 
ledge and bounced off, falling about ten feet past Cory. The 0.4 Friend held.

I was unconscious for about two minutes. After coming to, I asked Cory how 
I had fallen so far. Then, I told Cory not to make an SOS call and that I would 
walk it off, we would bail, and it would be fine. Cory instructed me to climb up to 
him. When I tried, I couldn’t move. I was in agony. Any sort of movement in my 
midsection caused intense pain. I knew I was in trouble. Cory fixed the rope and 
came down to me. He grabbed my inReach and initiated SOS. 
Somehow we also had cell service on the ledge. We were contacted by 911 and by 
Garmin operators. They assured us that a rescue was coming. Four and a half hours 
later, the Army National Guard helicopter arrived. They lowered a crewman. After 
ensuring I wasn’t in grave danger, he yelled, “I know you’re in a lot of f***ing pain 
right now, but I need you to get off your a** so I can get this harness under you!” I let

out a scream and did what he said. He secured me and off we went, dangling from the

fractures required surgery.
ANALYSIS
Our late start influenced my decision to place gear sparsely. I knew the danger and 
chose to ignore it. While there weren’t obvious placements for gear, I could have 
taken the time to get creative. 
Also, I had only been climbing for a little over three years. This accident could 
have happened to anyone, but I think my inexperience allowed me to ignore the risk. 
There was some detachment from how dangerous climbing really is.  
Looking back, I had begun to follow a line that was off route. After conversations 
with the one of the first ascensionists, I learned that the route-finding here stumps 
ma ny.

Despite my mistakes, I did a lot right. I was wearing a helmet, which may have 
saved me from a serious blow to the head. Additionally, my inReach allowed us to 
expedite the rescue. Though it’s not a “get out of jail free card,” it definitely saved me 
from more time on the wall. (Source: Max Conway.)
FREE SOLO FALL  
Rocky Mountain National Park, Ypsilon Mountain
On July 9, 26-year-old Bailee Mulholland fell approximately 500 feet while free soloing 
on the Blitzen Ridge (II 5.4) on Ypsilon Mountain. She did not survive the fall.
At the time of the accident, Mulholland and her partner, a 27-year-old male, were 
traversing the Four Aces; climbing around and over these towers provides the technical 
cruxes of the route. At some point in this 
section, Mulholland slipped and fell.

ANALYSIS
An ongoing trend has blurred the line 
between ultra-running and technical 
climbing, often involving large volumes 
of unroped scrambling over lower-
5th-class terrain. Mulholland had 
significant scrambling and climbing 
experience, but, as always, exposure 
to risk grows the longer one is 
unroped. It’s also important to know 
that an alpine environment, as found 
on Ypsilon Mountain—the summit is at 13,514 feet—has more loose, dirty, and 
wet rock than lower climbing venues. As always, climb with more caution in the 
mountains. (Source: National Park Service.)

On the evening of July 11, park rangers received a report of two climbers stranded and 
unable to complete their climb on Longs Peak. Neither party was injured. Rangers 
remained in contact with both climbers overnight, and National Park Service SAR 
members started toward Longs at first light on July 12. The two climbers had set out on 
the morning of July 11 from Chasm Lake and had begun to ascend the Casual Route (7 
pitches, 5.10a) on the Diamond. The climbers were unprepared for the conditions and 
did not have self-rescue or bivouac equipment. Rangers assisted the two climbers, and 
after climbing to the summit, they all came down via the north face of Longs Peak.

ANALYSIS
At 14,259 feet, Longs Peak is the highest peak inside Rocky Mountain National 
Park. For most of the year, Longs is in winter conditions, requiring mountaineering 
experience and equipment. All climbers should have knowledge of their climbing 
route, the necessary skills and equipment, self-rescue knowledge, and necessary 
gear for an unexpected overnight stay. *Editor’s Note: Climbing the Diamond has 
become the aspiration for an ever-growing number of climbers. Although the Casual 
Route is rated 5.10a, it bears little resemblance to short roadside or indoor routes of a 
similar grade. Completing an adventure climb like the Diamond requires a long mountain 
apprenticeship. Being unprepared not only risks the lives of the climbers, but also 
endangers rescuers. (Source: National Park Service.)

Unclipped from Bolt Hanger 
Clear Creek Canyon, Catslab 
Climber 1 (35) and I, Climber 2 (29), decided 
to go out for an easy day of climbing at 
Catslab on April 1. We were experienced, 
having climbed outdoors for about ten years 
each. Climber 1 led Overflow Direct (5.10a) 
with no issues and left the quickdraws for 
my lead. I started up and made it up to third 
bolt without any problems. About four feet 
above the third bolt, roughly 25 to 30 feet 
off the ground, I fell when my foot popped 
off. The quickdraw on the third bolt failed, 
and I kept falling until I stopped less than a 
foot short of the deck.

the carabiner connected to the bolt hanger

quickdraw. The flipped carabiner remained 
attached to the bolt hanger. The remaining 
carabiner and dogbone came down with me, 
attached to the rope. I’m not sure I could have 
done anything differently. (Sources: Climber

LOWERING ERROR | Rope Too Short, No Stopper Knot 
City of Rocks National Reserve, Super Hits Wall 
On May 26, Brock Anderson and his family witnessed a tragic accident on the Super Hits 
Wall at the City of Rocks. They were sharing laps on two climbs with another married 
couple when a group of four young men joined their group. Anderson wrote to A NAC:
The climbers had general knowledge of the area, but very little beta and no 
guidebook. We helped them identify the routes. One of the climbers, Kyle Melby (22), 
led Twist and Crawl (5.8). My son was reading a book directly under the route as we 
began wrapping up. I had a premonition that he wasn’t in a safe place. I asked him to 
move 50 feet to a shaded boulder. I thought nothing of it, just a Dad instinct thing.

Kyle was finishing Twist and Crawl, and the two others were preparing to climb 
Mystery Achievement (5.7), as our group headed out. We were 60 seconds down the 
trail when we heard Kyle fall, impacting the rock. He’d been lowered off the end of 
his rope. While we didn’t see the fall, we understand that he fell feet-first onto a flake 
near the bottom. He landed, tilted backward, and impacted the back left side of his 
head, crushing his helmet and sustaining a horrible head injury. The total fall was 
about 35 feet. *Editor’s Note: An accident in Oklahoma, with a similar outcome, was also 
caused by a climber falling and being flipped. See page 75.
I ran to my truck and grabbed my trauma kit, along with a Garmin inReach.

was belligerent and disoriented (often the case with head injuries). With the help of 
several other trained first responders, we were able to calm him somewhat, but we 
couldn’t keep him still. Within the hour, a helicopter was on the ground at Bread 
Loaves and several local agencies were on the scene. They helped transport Kyle via 
backboard to my truck and up the road to the helicopter. Kyle was flown to Pocatello. 
We believed he would be fine, but two days later he had died from his injuries.
ANALYSIS
Lowering accidents are all too frequent (see page 46). Twist and Crawl is 33 meters 
long and thus requires a 70-meter rope to allow an interrupted lower while retaining 
a reasonable margin of safety. A rough calculation, factoring in the length of route, 
length of fall, and rope stretch, indicates that Melby was most likely being lowered 
on a rope between 50 and 60 meters long.
------------------------------
length of fall, and rope stretch, indicates that Melby was most likely being lowered 
on a rope between 50 and 60 meters long.
Anderson, a licensed raft guide, provided these recommendations after the accident:
• Keep a closed system. Use stopper knots at the end of your rope.
• Speak out if you see an error. I wish I had said something. Some climbers may 
take offense or feel like you’re imposing on their experience, but it is worth 
going the extra mile. My premonition to move my son from the fall area could 
have included a friendly question about whether they knew the route was long 
and that a 60-meter rope might not be enough. 
• Learn about where you are climbing. Nuances like long ropes being standard at 
the City are important details. (Source: Brock Anderson.)

FALL ON ROCK | Probable Cross-Loaded Carabiner 
Red River Gorge, Bald Rock Recreational Preserve 
On October 8, I (Climber 1) was leading Grandpa Joe (5.9) in the Red River Gorge. 
I climbed two feet above the fourth bolt, onto a slight bulge, and announced I 
was going to take a practice fall. I dropped, felt a snap, flipped upside down, and 
continued to fall toward my belayer. It was much farther than I anticipated. At 
some point I hit the wall with my left arm. Both of us were wearing helmets, 
though I did not hit my head. I stopped five feet above the ground. 
We could see that the bolt-side carabiner of the fourth quickdraw was broken and 
no longer on the wall. I was quickly lowered to the ground and of course was very 
emotional and crying, as I had feared I 
was going to deck while falling.

The location of the carabiner break could

not know about this possibility until the

the quickdraw in the correct orientation: 
rubber-gasketed, rope-bearing end 
down, with the gate facing opposite of 
the direction that I was climbing. 
I wrote Black Diamond and they 
replied, “The ‘failure mode’ (looking at 
where and how the carabiner broke) is 
indicative of a nose-hook-type failure. 
We noticed that the wall you were 
climbing looks like it has fat glue-

to ‘hook’ onto this style of bolt very 
easily, but it can happen. It is more

getting back outdoors. To optimize my time, I hired an AMGA-certified guide.

On November 18, we had a great day, with me comfortably sport-leading five

and walked past Coll (5.10b/c). Although I was tired, the line looked too beautiful to 
ignore. 
Leading the climb, I came off just below the fourth bolt and landed on my ass on 
the bottom ledge. Pretty sure I fell about 40 feet. I was decelerating by the time I 
sat down hard on the ledge, which was about ten feet up on the route. I felt a jarring 
impact and strained the muscles in my back, but that appeared to be it.
ANALYSIS
The 80-pound weight difference between me and my belayer pulled her up when I 
came off. At the gym, I would have used an Ohm* or anchored my partner to the 
floor or a sandbag. Despite thinking of the sport crag as an outdoor gym (another 
mistake), I did not consider the weight differential. (Source: Robert Bernstein.)

FALL ON ICE | Collapsed Ice Pillar 
Hyalite Canyon 
On January 27, Lauren Olivia Smith and Bailey Lasko, both of Bozeman, Montana, 
were climbing Code Red (WI5) in nearby Hyalite Canyon. This single-pitch ice pillar 
has a longer approach than other popular venues in the canyon. The approach, 
combined with the avalanche hazard, made for a more serious outing.  
Smith was leading. As she reported to Climbing magazine, “[From the approach 
gully]...the pillar looked funky and off-kilter, in a shape I’d never seen before.... I 
remember thinking it doesn’t look quite right, but the part that was leaning seemed 
quite big, and we had a big freeze thaw [cycle], so I figured it was well attached.”

From a closer vantage, Smith confirmed that the upper part of Code Red appeared 
attached to the rock and, according to the article, “gave its stability no further 
thought.” At 15 feet up, Smith heard a cracking noise from above. The bottom half 
of the pillar then collapsed, toppling “like a falling tree.” Smith said, “I remember 
seeing a chunk of ice fall past me with my tool still in it.”
The point of detachment was 35 feet above Smith. With no intermediate 
protection, she—and the unanchored Lasko—“rocketed down the 30° approach 
slope.” Smith had been climbing on the lower-angle (left) side of the formation, and 
the inclined column fell away from her, so she avoided being crushed. The pair slid 
alongside the pillar before self-arresting after 100 feet, and they emerged unharmed.

Smith did well to assess temperature patterns in the days prior to the outing. She 
also chose a line that appeared well-bonded to the top of the cliff. While Smith was 
surprised at the collapse, it’s worth noting that the unusual crooked profile and 
obvious break in the column indicated the pillar had previously cracked and toppled 
partway, before refreezing at a Pisa-like tilt. Inclined columns are subject to axial 
compression, shear forces, and, in this case, buckling. Smith says she now completes 
a full 360-degree inspection of any free-standing ice pillar before climbing. (Sources:

FALL ON ICE  
Hyalite Canyon 
Two friends and I, David Baumann (32), were climbing in Hyalite Canyon over a 
weekend. I followed some WI3/4 climbs and led a WI3 without incident. 
On Sunday, February 5, I decided to lead The Fat One (WI3) on the Unnamed Wall 
since the ice looked plastic on the route. I chose the rightmost line, because it had 
plenty of rests and was not as steep. My intention was to put up a top-rope and climb 
the steeper lines on the left. 
I started climbing and everything was going well. I found a good rest for my feet 
and had a solid tool placement just above at hip height with my left and was placing 
my first screw at about hip height with my right. Either a foot slipped or a tool 
popped—I fell with both ice tools and the ice screw. I snagged my right crampon on 
some low-angle ice and felt a sharp pain before landing in deep powder snow.

some low-angle ice and felt a sharp pain before landing in deep powder snow. 
I ended up with a large blood blister on my left big toe and a cleanly fractured 
talus bone in my right foot, with several chips from my navicular bone. Several 
locaIs assisted in getting me off of the mountain. I was treated initially at an 
urgent-care facility in Bozeman and was then referred to a specialist. I am very 
lucky that nothing worse happened.
ANALYSIS
The accident happened so fast, but I must have pulled up on my left tool when I 
slipped, and in the end both of them popped. (See photo on next page.) This was my 
third season ice climbing, and I was beginning to lead. I thought this route was 
well within my ability if I climbed carefully and took my time. I think I need more 
practice placing ice screws and maintaining a stable stance. (Source: David Baumann.)

LEADER FALL ON ROCK | Placed Inadequate Protection 
Beartooth Mountains, Granite Peak 
On August 13, I (Adam M. Clark, 42) was guiding three clients up the east ridge of 
Granite Peak, a route consisting mostly of broken 3rd- and 4th-class alpine rock, with 
a few steep, short pitches of low 5th class. The weather was nearly perfect. We were 
about 400 vertical feet below the summit. I have guided this route multiple times and 
typically take a belay from clients when leading three or four short pitches. We had just 
completed a pitch of 5.5, and the three clients were all secured at the anchor. I got put 
on belay again and began leading up and right on the next pitch (5.4).

We were a little bit behind on time, and I was climbing fast. My belayer had 
some trouble paying out adequate slack. I slowed down and provided some coaching 
on feeding rope. I placed a solid cam after 15 to 20 feet of easy ground, having 
traversed slightly up and right from the belay. Another 15 to 20 feet up, I came to a 
steep and somewhat awkward move and tried placing another cam. I could not find 
a solid placement, so I re-racked the piece and kept climbing. At some point I fell. I 
do not remember the exact moment I came off the rock, nor the fall itself, due to a 
subsequent head injury.
My next recollection was slowly coming out of an unconscious state. I could not 
see but could hear one of my clients calling my name. I was struggling to breathe. 
Slowly I regained consciousness and realized I had fallen about 50 feet and impacted

full arm extension, then place a screw 
at hip height using the dominant hand 
while hanging straight-armed from

twisting the screw might have caused 
the otherwise solid pick placement to

plenty of rock on the way down. I was now hanging on the rope. I was doubled over in 
my harness, level with but 20 feet to the side of my clients. My breathing and vision 
improved as I sat up. One of my clients was texting and told me he had already hit SOS 
on his inReach, contacted a SAR team, and was coordinating a helicopter evacuation. 
He told me I had been mostly unresponsive for 15 to 20 minutes.
I soon became fully alert and oriented, and I took stock of my injuries. A large 
laceration in my left eyebrow was bleeding. Later, in the hospital, I learned that I 
had chipped an orbital bone in this spot just under my helmet. I had minor fractures 
on one rib and the bottom left side of my pelvis. My right shoulder was separated. I 
had a large contusion on my left hip and several lacerations on my legs. The worst 
injuries were several small fractures to my left wrist; my hand was dislocated about

The client who caught me had learned to belay only two days prior, during a 
training session. The one cam I had placed had held. I tensioned off this piece to join 
my clients at the anchor and clipped in. The four of us were on a very small ledge and 
crammed into a tight corner. Rescue would be difficult from there, and I decided that 
we should descend to a large ledge about 65 feet below. Fortunately, a couple of other 
parties were descending the route at that time, and one of them lowered all of us to the 
ledge. There we could unrope and tend to my injuries. The Gallatin County Search and 
Rescue helicopter arrived within an hour and hauled all four of us off the mountain.

ANALYSIS
Months later I still have no memory of the fall and cannot say exactly how I came off 
the rock. A hold may have broken, or I may have simply slipped. Regardless, haste 
was a contributing factor. My familiarity with the route led to some complacency. 
I began to rush and did not protect the pitch adequately. Instead of taking a few 
minutes to find more gear, I kept climbing, to save time and keep the team moving.
Many non-guided parties solo this route, only using a rope to rappel. Some don’t 
bring a rope at all and consider Granite’s east ridge a “scramble.” Not that long ago, 
I skipped belays on similar terrain because I was “comfortable with it.” I know many 
other guides and climbers who have done the same. I am very grateful for taking a 
belay that day.

FALL ON ROCK WHILE FOLLOWING | Rope Stretch
Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, Pine Creek Canyon, Mescalito   
Joey Portera, Jeff Gerner, and I, Brett Sampson, were kicking off our Red Rock 
trip with a classic 5.6 trad route: Cat in the Hat (CITH). As a team of three, 
we’ve found it most effective to climb one at a time on steep rock. Our plan for 
CITH was that Joey would lead the first two pitches, with Jeff following and me 
cleaning. Joey would swap leads with me for the last three pitches. 
Joey blasted off and linked the first and second pitches, taking the 60-meter 
rope up 180 feet (55 meters). Joey put Jeff on belay and he started climbing. 
Shortly after starting up the first pitch, Jeff fell. The rope stretch sent him for 
a 10-to-15-foot fall down the broken terrain that led up to the actual climbing.

a 10-to-15-foot fall down the broken terrain that led up to the actual climbing. 
There was enough velocity and rope stretch in his fall to break his ankle in three 
places when his foot caught a small ledge. His dislocated foot was bent 90° in the 
wrong direction.
One of the best decisions we made earlier that day was to carry Rocky Talkies. 
I was still on the ground and witnessed everything, so I was able to give guidance 
to Joey about how to lower Jeff, when to stop, and when to go extra slow. 
Once Jeff was on solid ground, Joey and I talked out a plan. We had two 
problems: Jeff’s severely broken ankle and Joey being stuck two pitches up. He 
would get down safely, even if it meant lowering himself off a single strand and 
leaving the rope. There were probably five hours of daylight left, so the clock 
was ticking. 
There is little to no cell service in Red Rock, so I left the scene and headed

There is little to no cell service in Red Rock, so I left the scene and headed 
down the climbers’ trail with the hopes of finding service for calling 911, but 
to no avail. But the texting feature via Apple’s SOS satellite service worked on 
one of our phones (see page 104 for another Apple SOS rescue). It took 40 minutes 
of back-and-forth with the 911 operator, but soon enough, a group of six Clark 
County Fire Department personnel and a Red Rock wilderness ranger arrived.
They’d hoped to carry Jeff out with a stretcher, but the climbers’ trail is 
narrow, cactus laced, and rocky. A helicopter would be needed. Above, Joey 
waited until a team of climbers rappelled down and he could descend with them. 
The helicopter picked Jeff up at 3:10 p.m.

ANALYSIS
A key takeaway for us was that walkie-talkies are worth the extra weight. Being 
able to communicate kept everyone in the know and brought clarity to an uncertain 
situation. Also, climbers should anticipate rope stretch for followers. We never 
considered a “follower” fall injurious, even though there was 180 feet of rope out. Be 
cautious when linking pitches if it means the follower cannot be seen from the top of 
the pitch. (Source: Brett Sampson.)
When Jeff Gerner fell while following a long pitch in Red Rock, rope stretch generated enough 
speed and distance to cause a displaced ankle fracture when his foot clipped a small ledge (see 
facing page). The rugged terrain necessitated a helicopter extraction. Brett Sampson

FALL ON ICE 
North Conway, Cathedral Ledge   
On Sunday, January 28, at noon, Ryan Cooper (21) fell about 30 feet while leading 
pitch one of the classic Repentance ice climb (3 pitches, WI5) at Cathedral Ledge. 
His fell was stopped by an ice screw and his belayer. Upon impact, his crampon 
snagged on the ice, which caused Ryan to suffer a serious lower leg injury. He 
was lowered to the ground by his partner and then was stabilized and evacuated 
by emergency responders to Memorial Hospital in North Conway. There, he had 
surgery for a broken leg.
ANALYSIS
Ice climbing poses the usual falling hazards one experiences in climbing rock. Add 
to this the higher risk of injury due to crampon points snagging on ice, rock, or 
clothing before the rope stops the fall. Repentance is a steep, narrow ice flow, often 
candled and aerated, and can be quite technical, depending on conditions. Ryan was

should be approached cautiously. Falls, especially while leading, are to be avoided.

state park road to reach the summit area, then some of the responders hiked down to 
a treed ledge to reach the base of the climb. Allen was alert and conscious, with back 
pain but with feeling in his limbs. He was stabilized, placed in a litter, and hoisted to 
the cliff top. He reached the ambulance at the summit parking area by 10 p.m. and 
was transported to Memorial Hospital in North Conway for treatment.

and relatively hot weather may have somewhat fatigued him. When possible, take 
the time and make the effort to find stances where you can ensure your protection 
placements are solid. In a few spots, you can step down and right of the Retaliation 
crack to get a good view of your placements and preview the climbing ahead. Solid 
cam placements generally have lobes at least 50 percent retracted, with the stem 
aligned with the fall line and a sling long enough to prevent rotation by the rope as 
you climb past. (Sources: Sgt. Alex Lopashanski of the New Hampshire Fish and Game

On July 30, we were a party of six trying to crag at Cathedral Ledge after a night of 
pouring rain. We decided to get a late start to let the routes dry out. Since the Barber 
Wall is the highest crag at Cathedral and gets sun, we thought it would dry quicker. 
We didn’t find the main trail, but managed to go through the forest and arrive their 
around 1 p.m. Most of the routes were dripping wet. My belayer and I tried Grim 
Reaper (5.10d R), while the other four searched for climbable routes. 
I roped up and got to a ledge. Ten or fifteen feet up, I placed a green-yellow offset 
Alien in a dirty, mossy crack at hip level. The smaller lobes of the offset cammed well, 
but the larger side didn’t. I made a few layback moves to an okay stance and placed a 
terrible number 0.5 cam (both sets of lobes were tipped out) in a downward-flaring 
crack. I tried to gain the next big layback flake, but the route was dirty, mossy, and wet.

terrible number 0.5 cam (both sets of lobes were tipped out) in a downward-flaring

I lost confidence and called “take.” My belayer asked if I could downclimb. I could 
have downclimbed without much difficulty, but I panicked and kept yelling to take. 
The belayer took in the slack, but the 0.5 cam didn’t hold body weight and 
popped. The offset Alien also popped, resulting in me tumbling down to the belayer’s 
level. I hit two intermediate ledges and eventually landed on some dirt, rolled, and 
was stopped by a big tree. I fell 20 or 30 feet. I had a helmet, so the main impact was 
on my hip and upper back. The belayer wasn’t anchored, so they slipped and stopped 
a few feet from the edge of a cliff below. There was a 200-foot drop behind him where 
he could have tumbled the whole way down.

ANALYSIS
• After the accident, the staff at a local climbing store said the Barber Wall is the 
wettest cliff at Cathedral Ledge. We should have asked about conditions.
• I had climbed a wet 5.8 crack on gear without any problem the prior week, which 
made me too ambitious. I underestimated how conditions affect a climb and the 
gear placements.  
• Onsight climbing on granite is very different from what I am accustomed to—
overhanging sport climbs with obvious big holds. 
• I could have found better gear placements, especially for the first piece.
• Downclimbing could have saved the day, but I panicked. Being mostly a sport 
climber, “take” in this case promoted a false sense of security. It made me ignore

FALL ON ROCK | Loose Bolt Hanger
Sundown Ledge, Main Cliff
In the late afternoon of May 28, Jesse Han (25) and friends were sport climbing at 
Sundown Ledge. He was attempting an as-yet-unnamed and unclimbed route just to 
the right of Mithras. After scrambling to a ledge, he stick-clipped the first bolt and 
climbed past it. While working the moves approaching the second bolt, he jumped 
off, about 25 feet above the ground. When his fall loaded the first bolt, the hanger 
released, resulting in a ground fall.

released, resulting in a ground fall. 
Han was able to land on his feet in a small flat spot between boulders. He was 
conscious but suffered injuries to his lower extremities. The hanger and permadraw 
that were attached to the first bolt remained 
clipped to his rope. The bolt stud remained 
in the rock, and the nut was gone. 
Fish and Game officers, Conway Fire, and 
Lakes Region Search and Rescue responded 
to the call for assistance at 7:30 p.m. 
Rescuers stabilized Han and transported 
him by litter to the Boulder Loop trailhead at 
8:15 p.m. Han chose to self-evacuate to the 
hospital to avoid the cost of an ambulance

to a climbing accident. See: americanalpineclub.org/rescue.
ANALYSIS
The bolt in question is a solid 3/8-inch stainless-steel wedge bolt in syenite, a granite-
like rock type. However, this bolt protects a traverse, and when a climber traverses, the 
rope may intermittently pull a permadraw at an angle. During prior attempts on the 
route, the back-and-forth motion of the permadraw had caused the nut to unthread 
from the bolt. Han did not notice the loose hanger when he clipped and climbed past it.
When using bolts, try to ensure the hanger has not loosened and the nut remains 
fully threaded onto the bolt stud. Carrying a small crescent wrench to the crag to 
tighten loose nuts is a good idea. (Several models of nut tools have built-in wrenches.) A

FALL ON ROCK | Off Route, Loose Rock
Sandia Mountains, Juan Tabo Canyon   
On November 25, Brian Beyer (male, 25) was 
climbing with his brother Daniel (male, 27) on the 
Prow in Juan Tabo Canyon. They began the day at 
6:30 a.m., looking to climb one of the unnamed 
lower-5th-class routes up the formation. They 
planned to start early and be out of the mountains 
before dark. 
The approach took longer than expected, and 
they didn’t get to the base of the Prow until 9 a.m. 
After gearing up and selecting a line, they began their 
climb. After a few pitches, the rock quality started to 
degrade and the climb started to get harder. 
On the fifth and last pitch of the climb, Brian

was 15 feet above a number 2 cam when he pulled 
out a bowling-ball-sized rock and took a 40-foot fall, 
landing in a bush and injuring his foot. Daniel rope-burned his hand while catching 
the fall. After checking each other’s injuries and deciding to self-rescue, Brian decided 
to continue ascending with his injured foot. They ended up topping out on a false 
summit as the sun was setting, around 5 p.m., way later than expected. 
The team had a windbreaker and a sweater between them, and temperatures 
rapidly began to drop. After failing to locate a safe descent route, they decided to climb 
one more pitch to find a better descent. They slowly made their way up the last section 
(low 5th class) of the Prow and found a rappel station. They were able to complete five 
rappels on 60-meter twin ropes to reach the bottom. Once there, they slowly made 
their way to the car, with Brian nursing a foot sprain that required no treatment. They

their way to the car, with Brian nursing a foot sprain that required no treatment. They 
arrived at their car around 3 a.m., after “shivering for hours.”
ANALYSIS
Brian and his brother had over nine years of climbing experience each. Brian stated 
that they both were pretty confident in their climbing ability but needed to be smarter 
with their skills. He stated that they were overconfident, which led them to begin their 
climb in the wrong spot. 
At the top of the first pitch, they discussed being off route, but decided to push 
forward, even after encountering deteriorating rock quality. Brian stated they were 
“trying to convince ourselves we were on the right route.” Looking back, he said he 
would have reevaluated the route and made better decisions on pushing forward.

He also stated that they both should have better prepared by bringing more jackets 
and clothing to prepare for a worst-case scenario. The warm desert sun in late fall can 
feel great during the day, making a jacket uncomfortably hot, but as soon as the sun 
sets and the winds pick up, a clothing system to stay dry and warm is necessary to 
prevent hypothermia. (Source: Brian Beyer.)

RAPPEL ERROR | Inappropriate Use of Prusik
Albuquerque, Ranger Station Wall   
On May 5, Climber A was participating as an assistant instructor in a “Climb 
School” presented by the New Mexico Mountain Club. During a lunch break, she was 
practicing a 15-foot-long rappel on a single strand of rope using a Petzl Grigri. She 
had done this previously as a student on another training session, and she was being 
advised by the instructor for her group. 
The Grigri was extended from her harness with a sling. I don’t remember the 
exact length, but the Grigri was within her reach, so it could not have been more 
than 24 inches. A prusik hitch was applied to the rappel rope above the Grigri. As 
Climber A backed up to the cliff edge she found it difficult to move because the 
prusik was catching on the rope. To counter this, she repeatedly fed rope through 
the Grigri to create slack, backed up until the rope became tight, then pulled the

prusik was catching on the rope. To counter this, she repeatedly fed rope through 
the Grigri to create slack, backed up until the rope became tight, then pulled the 
hitch down toward her. This maneuver required her to take her brake hand off 
the rope. As she backed over the edge with the Grigri’s lever open and slack in the 
rope, she began to fall. 
Climber A reflexively tightened her hand on the prusik, causing it to release. 
Since the Grigri’s lever was open, she fell, unimpeded, to the ground. She landed 
on the upper side of her back. Her head hit the ground, cracking her helmet. 
Climber A sustained a laceration to the back of her head from the broken helmet 
shell, hairline fractures to two ribs and three vertebral processes, a partially 
collapsed lung, several deep contusions, and rope burns on her hand. However, she 
was able to walk to the responding ambulance.

was able to walk to the responding ambulance. 
She spent five hours in the hospital and was able to resume climbing after a 
relatively short recovery. This accident could have been much worse if not for the 
short fall distance (15 feet). The residual friction from the Grigri, the hitch, and the 
climber’s hand slowed Climber A’s descent. She also landed feet first, which absorbed 
some of the impact. The ground was flat-surfaced, hard, and slightly down-sloping.
ANALYSIS
The primary accident cause was the use of incompatible techniques that canceled 
each other out. The Grigri should be attached directly to the belay loop, not 
extended from a harness. The misuse of a friction hitch as a “backup” eliminated 
control of the rappel. Simply put, the Grigri, if properly used, is its own backup: If 
you let go, it stops your descent (see Editor’s Note below).
After her recovery, Climber A participated in a club training session on

you let go, it stops your descent (see Editor’s Note below).
After her recovery, Climber A participated in a club training session on 
rappelling with a Grigri, using the proper setup and a top-belay from a separate 
rope. The top-rope belay as a backup for practice rappels is the preferred choice 
and would have prevented a similar accident in 2023 (see page 79). (Source: David 
Sweet.) *Editor’s Note: When asked about the use of extensions and backups with a 
Grigri, the company wrote to ANAC: “Petzl does not recommend using an extension 
or a friction hitch backup when rappelling with the Grigri. Of course you can use 
a sling extension, but you need to be careful not to extend it so far that it becomes 
difficult to operate the Grigri. The Grigri attached to the belay loop is easier to 
operate. Adding a friction hitch below the Grigri will make it quite awkward and 
tricky to operate the Grigri rappel.”

SHAWANGUNKS ANNUAL SUMMARY
Mohonk Preserve   
During the 2023 season in the Mohonk Preserve, there were numerous climbing-
related incidents that resulted in either lower- or upper-extremity injuries. Much 
effort has been put forth within the climbing community to help educate climbers 
on safe practices and reduce total climbing-related incidents, as well as to reduce 
the severity of accidents that do occur. When comparing the trend of recent 
years to that of the last century, these efforts have been successful. Nonetheless, 
climbing accidents are an inherent risk of the sport, and climbers should exercise 
the appropriate precautions.
In 2023, there were ten lead climbing falls, two bouldering falls, and one 
environmental accident that required SAR rangers to respond to climbers in distress. 
Among these, one incident was due to an environmental hazard and another was

Among these, one incident was due to an environmental hazard and another was

climbers to be attentive not only to climbing-specific hazards, such as falls, but also 
to their personal health while climbing and to the environment they are climbing in.

SNAKEBITE
Shawangunks, Trapps Area
On May 13, a female climber (30) was 
on the approach to a climb called 
Sort of Damocles (1 pitch, 5.8) in the 
popular Trapps area. The individual 
was bitten by a copperhead and later 
treated by SAR rangers. Though 
snakebites are relatively uncommon, 
climbers can get bitten if they step 
too close or do not see snakes. 
This was the case for the climber. 
Unfortunately, she also elected to

ANALYSIS
It is common in the Gunks to find 
various snakes along approach trails. 
The 2023 season saw an increase in 
copperhead activity in the Trapps. 
Though rarely fatal to humans, copperhead envenomation can cause severe 
wounds and scarring, especially if untreated at a facility equipped for snakebites. 
Wearing protective clothing, including pants and hiking shoes, can help protect 
climbers from a snakebite and prevent injury. (Sources: Mohonk Preserve Rangers,

On June 13, a male climber (41) sustained a leader fall on Raunchy (5.8) and 
sustained minor injuries. After the fall, it was determined that the patient, a 
diabetic, was hypoglycemic. The extent to which hypoglycemia contributed to his 
fall, or if there were other contributing factors, is unclear. Rangers responding to the 
incident treated and managed the patient’s low blood sugar before addressing and 
treating the other injuries. The patient required some splinting and care to be safely 
extracted from the cliff area.

I started up the third pitch and climbed 10 to 15 feet above the belay. Before 
reaching the first horn (protection), I shifted my weight to my right foot and felt 
my foot slip. I began to slide. At this point I wasn’t concerned, since I was on low-
angle slab and expected to slide until the rope went tight. Unfortunately, as I slid 
past the belay, my left foot caught a tiny ledge, twisting my ankle and flipping me 
on my back. C. did a great job pulling in as much rope as he could, and I stopped six 
feet below the anchor. 
My initial assessment revealed some minor abrasions on my side and elbows, 
but when I tried to stand I felt severe pain in my left ankle. Within a few minutes,

I was hyper-focused on the first 
pitch and then mentally shifted 
gears when I started up the third. 
In my head, climbing the remainder 
of the route was easy, and I got 
complacent. If I had given the entire 
route the same focus that I did on 
the first pitch, I would not have 
slipped and sustained this injury.

six, and we both take pride in our risk assessment and careful approach. The first 
route we planned to climb was occupied, so we found a nearby route that neither 
of us had previously tried. We incorrectly identified the route as a 5.7; it actually 
was Goodness Gracious (5.10a). I quickly realized the route was harder, but I had 
previously led up to 5.11 at Pilot Mountain, so I went on and clipped three bolts 
and then hung to work out the crux. It involved throwing a high heel hook and 
manteling onto an awkward bulge. 
I got partially over the bulge and needed to make one more move but couldn’t 
find a good handhold. I ended up falling off. Instead of getting a catch, I hit the 
ground after falling 20 feet. Both feet landed on a flat rock step on the main 
hiking trail. My belayer took up enough slack that the rope started to catch right 
as my feet hit. After lying on the ground, overcoming the initial shock and pain,

hiking trail. My belayer took up enough slack that the rope started to catch right 
as my feet hit. After lying on the ground, overcoming the initial shock and pain, 
I realized the alpine quickdraw that I had clipped into the third bolt was still 
clipped to the rope. Somehow, as I was wrestling with the move, it had come 
unclipped from the hanger. I was wearing a helmet, but fortunately I did not hit 
my head or back during the fall.
Alerted by a nearby climber, a team of park employees, other climbers, and 
volunteers arrived in about 30 to 45 minutes and loaded me onto a transport 
basket. For the next hour and a half, they carried me back up to the summit, 
where an ambulance was waiting. At one point, they rigged a rope and hauled 
me up a steep hill to shorten the journey. At the hospital, X-rays showed I had 
fractured both heel bones. One of the fractures was bad enough to require 
surgery, and I received a plate and four screws.

ANALYSIS
The first mistake we made was not being sure of what route we were climbing. 
The route I fell from was on my to-do list, but the plan was to warm up with an 
easier climb. The second mistake was the positioning of the carabiner on the bolt 
hanger. I knew that it was possible for a carabiner to unclip from a bolt hanger if 
the carabiner is pulled up in a certain way. I try to keep the spine of the carabiner 
pointed in the direction I’m climbing. When I was clipping the third bolt, I thought 
I would climb toward the left side of the bulge. The line turned out to go right, and 
somehow the quickdraw came unclipped. 
*Editor’s Note: In rare instances, carabiners can come unclipped from bolt hangers. 
There are several examples in this book (see pages 55 and 58). A few things to consider:

There are several examples in this book (see pages 55 and 58). A few things to consider: 
The hanger-clipping-end carabiner should be loose in the sling, never held by a rubber 
keeper. Both carabiners on a quickdraw should be oriented with the gates facing the 
same direction. As Alec mentions, quickdraws should be clipped so the spine of the 
carabiner is oriented in the direction of travel and the gates are facing away. 
The direction in which one clips a bolt hanger also can be a factor. Clipping the 
opposite direction from the angle of the carabiner hole will minimize the possibility of 
the carabiner levering against the hanger and unclipping. Almost all plate-style bolt 
hangers have the clipping section on the left side of the hanger. So, the ideal clipping 
direction would be from left to right. Other factors (like the ones mentioned above) 
may be more important in a given situation, but when you have a choice, this is the 
preferred method.

direction would be from left to right. Other factors (like the ones mentioned above) 
may be more important in a given situation, but when you have a choice, this is the 
preferred method. 
For even more security, a safer play is to flip the gate so it opens downward. Better 
yet, if the clip is critical, e.g., before or after a runout, use a locking carabiner on the 
hanger end of the quickdraw. (Sources: Alec Gilmore and the Editors.)
It’s an unsettling thought, but carabiners can, on rare occasion, unclip from bolt hangers. When 
the bolt is clipped from right to left and the hanger angles down to the right, tension on the 
quickdraw can raise the carabiner and lever the gate open. Foster Denney

FATAL LEADER FALL | Protection Pulled Out
Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge, The Narrows
On September 22, Levi Wilkins (36), Jake Warren (34), and Jordan Cobb (27) were climbing 
Leaning Tower Direct (2 pitches, 5.9) in the Narrows. Warren recounted to A NAC:
We turned the two-pitch route into three for belay-building and multi-pitch 
practice. At the base of our third pitch we belayed on a sloping stance (angled 30°). 
Jordan attempted to lead this final pitch (~45 feet, 5.9), placing a number 2 Camalot 
and climbing higher and then placed a 0.4 Camalot. He got pumped, lost some 
confidence, and asked to lower. 
I attempted, using the gear that was in place. I also failed and fell onto the 0.4, 
putting me at eye level with the placement. It wasn’t solid anymore. The rope may 
have caused it to walk. I lowered and I told Levi about the cam. He climbed up while 
I belayed. He got to the 0.4, removed it, evaluated the rock, and replaced the cam. He

I belayed. He got to the 0.4, removed it, evaluated the rock, and replaced the cam. He 
climbed above the gear, tried the moves, and fell.
Levi was 15 or 20 feet above us. The 0.4 was two to three feet below his tie-in and 
four feet to the left. The cam blew out of its pocket. Levi’s feet struck both the belay 
stance and Jordan’s head. Levi flipped upside down and backward. The number 2 held 
and caught him about five to ten feet below the belay ledge. The total fall was 20 to 30 
feet, but the tension in the rope accelerated the top half of his body down and backward 
in an arc. The back of his head (below his helmet) struck the rock. He was unconscious.
Jordan was momentarily dazed from Levi hitting him. The next thing he 
remembered was me yelling “get him up!” All three of us were wearing helmets. I lifted

remembered was me yelling “get him up!” All three of us were wearing helmets. I lifted 
Levi with one arm, and we grabbed him by the harness and arms. Jordan anchored Levi 
and helped me lower him until his head was lying on my lap. I angled his head to open 
his airway. At this point, he took a huge gulp of air. Once Levi was situated, I lowered 
Jordan to the ground to find help and cell service. Once I had a hand free, I checked my 
phone. Miraculously, I had enough service to call 911. 
I described landmarks and talked the dispatcher through Mountain Project for 
pictures and descriptions. Fortunately, they were able to get my GPS coordinates. I 
knew it was a race against time. Having SAR experience, I told dispatch that the only 
way Levi would survive was if he got helicoptered out.
Levi’s breathing was ragged and unsteady. I carefully placed our rope under his 
shoulders and lifted his chest with my foot up so I could better tilt his head. By then
------------------------------
Levi’s breathing was ragged and unsteady. I carefully placed our rope under his 
shoulders and lifted his chest with my foot up so I could better tilt his head. By then 
I had found a wound across the base of his skull. I applied pressure with my left hand 
while steadying his head and neck. His blood ran down the granite. It was bright red 
and the flow was very slow.
The whole time I was talking to him, even though he was unconscious. When his 
breathing slowed, I would yell at him to keep fighting. Levi was a Stage IV cancer 
survivor. I yelled at him that he didn’t beat cancer only to die up here. Then, he would 
take a huge gulp of air. This happened about eight times.
His breathing slowed and became shallower. Jordan returned with two EMS 
personnel and I relayed everything I could. They told me a helicopter and high-angle 
rescue team were on the way.
------------------------------

Finally Levi’s breathing stopped. 
The dispatcher told me to begin 
chest compressions. It was nearly 
impossible to maintain good form 
on the incline, but she counted 
cadence while I gave compressions 
for two hours.
The chief of the high-angle rescue 
team had hiked in, and called down 
from above. He said, “Brother, there’s 
no easy way to tell you this: You 
can stop giving Levi compressions 
now.” I stood next to Levi’s body 
for another 45 minutes. I dropped 
the rope to Jordan, and he gathered 
everything up at the base. The rescue 
team hoisted me out and an Army 
helicopter recovered Levi.

unpredictably failed after holding 
repeated falls. As Warren wrote to A NAC, “Days later, I inspected the cam and it 
was in perfect working order. The only thing that makes any sense is that the rock 
around the placement crumbled when loaded.”
Placing more protection is usually a good idea, but options were limited. The 
runout above the critical piece was short, and Wilkins was only ten to 15 feet above 
the belay. That last fact, along with compromised rock in the key placement, must 
have contributed to the placement failure. With a short length of rope out, energy 
absorption is lower. The elevated load applied an unavoidably high impact force 
onto the failed placement.
That Wilkins flipped, striking his head, was bad luck. Cobb had retreated from 
the same place, and Warren took a similar fall (slightly below where Wilkins fell)

That Wilkins flipped, striking his head, was bad luck. Cobb had retreated from 
the same place, and Warren took a similar fall (slightly below where Wilkins fell) 
and remained upright. Warren recalled that the inversion “may have been that he 
hit Jordan harder than the ledge. It was all so fast. I’m 80 percent sure his feet hit 
the ledge; but the medical examiner reported no injuries to his ankles/feet. They 
did report that he fractured his C1 and C2 vertebrae.” *Editor’s Note: These top two 
vertebrae in the spine are considered a very serious place to suffer injury.
Unfortunately, getting flipped was probably the fatal factor (see page 56). In an 
article on falling safely, Climbing magazine wrote, “The difference between hitting 
the wall softly and hitting the wall hard can, when you’re falling upside-down, be 
the difference between minor injury or serious injury, life or death.” (Sources: Jake

FALL ON ROCK | Rappel Error
Smith Rock State Park, Brogan Spire 
On August 6, Jean Bury (58) and her husband, Scott, topped out on The Cave Route (3 
pitches, 5.7 R) on Brogan Spire. Jean rappelled first from the summit. This diagonal 
rappel demanded that she walk her feet down an angling groove in order to get to the 
anchor on top of pitch two. As Jean was descending, she lost her footing. This caused 
her to pendulum far to the left.
As she swung, the ropes grated over a rock that formed the lip on an overhang. 
Falling sideways, she landed in an adjacent gully and impacted the rock. She 
sustained major head injuries to the temple and ear and split her helmet in two. She 
also suffered a shattered patella, a broken rib, and two broken toes.

the area also responded to the location and provided first aid while 15 members 
of the Deschutes County Search and Rescue Mountain Rescue Unit (MRU) 
responded. Four MRU members climbed to her location. They further stabilized 
Jean’s life-threatening injuries and packaged her in a litter. They then lowered 
her down the remainder of the route and crossed an irrigation canal to meet 
an awaiting ambulance.

ANALYSIS
This rappel route is known to be awkward and to require route-finding skills to 
navigate safely. Toby Butterfield on Mountain Project wrote that the rappel from 
the summit can “be a bit dicey. ...and if you happen to get blown off or fall off while 
rap-walking backwards towards the P2 anchors, you’re in for a big swing...”   
There is a newer bolted rappel line to the climbers’ left of the angling groove 
that was established to avoid this exact type of accident. Jean was unaware of 
this new rappel route, so the pair essentially rappelled the line of ascent, instead 
of the new descent that follows the fall line from the summit. When rappelling, 
identifying the next set of anchors from above is ideal but not always feasible. 
In this case, Jean was initially unable to locate the anchors and created a large 
pendulum potential by checking around both sides of the fall line. Losing her

In this case, Jean was initially unable to locate the anchors and created a large 
pendulum potential by checking around both sides of the fall line. Losing her

likely saved her life. (Source: Caleb Bryce, Deschutes County Search and Rescue.)
LEAD FALL ON ROCK | Cam

Smith Rock State Park, Morning 
Glory Wall 
At the end of a great day of climbing 
on May 15, my partner Lance (30) and 
I, Garrett Genereux (34), decided to 
do one last route on our way out of the 
main area. We stopped at Lion’s Chair 
Start (5.10c/d R). As usual, no one was 
on it despite the routes on both sides 
being busy. I had been on the route 
several times before.

I didn’t realize how tired I was until 
on the route. I was trying to conserve 
energy by not placing too much pro. I 
was about one body length above my 
first two pieces of gear and placed a 
number 0.4 cam. My belayer asked if it 
was a good placement. I assured him 
that it was fine and kept moving. As 
I approached the first bolt, where the 
crack pinches down, I became very 
fatigued and started getting scared. 
I wanted to clip the bolt as fast as I 
could. I was able to hang the draw at my farthest reach. Then I pulled up rope 
to make the clip. As I inched the rope closer to the lower carabiner, my left foot 
greased off and I fell. 
There was a ton of rope in the system, and when I heard the 0.4 plink out of the 
crack, I knew I was going to the ground. My left foot briefly hit, and then I landed

on my butt. I lost my breath and made some guttural noises trying to get it back. 
I lay supine. My ankle hurt, and my lower back was pretty tight, but I had full 
sensation and movement below. I even remember feeling like I needed to pee while 
lying there and took that as a good sign. 
The folks nearby were able to clean up the lower pieces, and someone with the 
longest stick clip I’ve ever seen snagged the draw off the bolt. Someone let me 
borrow their camp chair. I was able to slip off my climbing shoes. My left ankle was 
dark in color and already beginning to swell, but I could bear weight and felt that 
we didn’t need a crew to carry me out.

hiked to the road. I was dropped off at the emergency room in Redmond. My ankle 
was just a soft-tissue injury, and my back had compression fractures at T12, L1, 
and L2. I was soon discharged. Subsequent follow-up determined all was good. Two 
months later, I was back climbing and feeling well. Since then I have even gotten 
back on the same route. I sewed it with 11 pieces rather than three.
ANALYSIS
Simply put, I did not place enough protection. In the first 15 feet, I only placed three 
pieces: a nut and a cam protecting the start and then the 0.4 cam that pulled. Also, 
I could have climbed a bit higher to a better hold and clipped the bolt with the same 
amount of rope in the system as I had when I fell. I also should have checked in with 
myself mentally and physically. While it is not the most difficult route, it does take 
focus and it gets an R rating in the newest guide. (Source: Garrett Genereux.)

GROUND FALL | Removed Anchor before Rappel
Smith Rock State Park, Rope de Dope Block 
On April 21, Cohen Schaumann (11) fell 40 feet to the ground while climbing at 
Smith Rock with his grandfather, Scott Phillips. The pair had climbed together on 
multiple occasions over the prior year. Their sessions included top-roping and a 
successful rappel lesson. On the 21st, Phillips and Schaumann were climbing on 
Rope de Dope, a large block with easily accessed bolt anchors that facilitate top-
roping. It is a popular destination for climbing classes and beginners.
Phillips and Schaumann climbed some 5.7s, and then the youngster tried and 
struggled on a few of the 5.9s. They decided to climb Rope de Dope Crack (5.8). 
Phillips scrambled up the back of the rock (accessed via a ladder) to set up the climb.

Phillips scrambled up the back of the rock (accessed via a ladder) to set up the climb. 
Unprompted, Schaumann followed Phillips to the top of the rock. Phillips intended 
only to set up a top-rope, but when Schaumann appeared, the former decided to give 
him some rappel practice.
Phillips set up the anchor by the book and dropped the rope with both ends 
clearly seen on the ground. He set up Schaumann on a two-strand rappel with a 
tube-style rappel device. The youngster was clipped in with a PAS. According to 
Climbing.com, “Now Cohen leaned back on his rappel device, ‘and it looked good,’ 
said Phillips. ‘His [PAS] was loose, the anchor was tight, and he had his full weight 
on the rappel device. I felt good about everything.’”
Phillips climbed down to the ground and circled the block to put his grandson on 
a fireman’s belay. Schaumann appeared to be ready. All he needed to do was unclip

his PAS and rappel, something he had done quite recently. Phillips recounted in 
Climbing, “At this point, I walked closer and loosely grabbed the ropes, and took my 
phone out to take another picture of him. Then I heard a yell, looked up, and he was 
coming down feet first.” Schaumann hit the wall midway down, “and then he went 
pretty much face first into the ground.” 
Schaumann had fallen 40 feet, narrowly avoiding some jagged rocks. Because 
they were at a popular venue, help arrived fast. This included a Wilderness First 
Responder, a police officer with EMT certification, and wilderness response team in 
training from Western Oregon University.
Schaumann suffered a broken pelvis, wrist, ankle, and ribs. He had two collapsed 
lungs, a lacerated liver and kidney, and fractures in two spinal vertebrae. According 
to his family’s GoFundMe site, Schaumann  was expected to make a full recovery.

ANALYSIS
When Schaumann landed on the ground, he was accompanied by the anchor slings, 
locking carabiners, the rope, and his PAS. He had apparently dismantled the anchor 
before starting to rappel. Said Phillips, “In his inexperience and exuberance to rappel, I 
think he just unclipped the entire anchor along with his [PAS] when he went to rappel.”
In an ideal world, there could have been one person at the top to oversee the rappel 
and one person at the bottom to provide a fireman’s belay. There might even have been 
a top-rope belay while Schaumann rappelled. Such steps likely would have prevented 
the accident. However, given that the pair had successfully practiced rappelling 
previously, such techniques also might be overabundant. It would be hard to anticipate

GROUND FALL | Clipped Knot Tails Instead of Knot
Custer State Park, Sylvan Lake Area 
On July 4, Person 1 (23) was climbing with two novices in the area behind Sylvan Lake 
on a wall with accessible top-rope anchors. While setting up the top-rope, Person 1 
tethered themselves into a “protective bolt,” separate from the two-bolt anchor. They 
incorporated a quad to build the anchor. 
Person 1 moved their tether carabiner from the “protective bolt” and clipped it 
into several strands of the quad. When they stepped out onto the face and sat back in 
their harness, they fell to the ground.

into several strands of the quad. When they stepped out onto the face and sat back in

Person 1 fell 40 feet. Their momentum was slowed by a large chimney flake 
two-thirds of the way down and a five-foot slab section at the base. They remained 
in supine position on the ground while a passerby called 911. The novice climbers 
used clothing layers to keep Person 1 warm. A SAR team arrived in ten minutes and 
an ambulance within 20. Person 1 had been wearing a helmet and suffered no life-
threatening injuries. They were backboarded to an ambulance, having suffered two 
lacerations, a large contusion on the buttocks, and a sprained shoulder.
------------------------------
UTAH    I    81   
ANALYSIS
Person 1 made the quad from aramid cord, tied with a flat overhand knot to form a loop. 
The loop was doubled over, and two overhand knots formed the legs and masterpoints of 
the quad. Two long tails extending from the original flat overhand knot were accidentally 
tucked into that leg knot, forming an unsecured loop. The loop failed when weighted as 
the tails slipped out of the knot, and Person 1 fell to the ground. 
Person 1 wrote to A NAC, “My greatest lesson has been to avoid complacency 
and haste; systems are always worth another double-check. I failed to recognize 
how a small difference when dressing a knot can have serious consequences. One 
should tether directly to the appropriate components—in this instance, one of the 
masterpoints.” (Source: Person 1.)

*Editor’s Note: This incident echoes the practice of tucking a long tail back into a knot 
or tying an overhand knot in a long tail as a “backup.” Most common instances of this 
involve figure 8 follow-through knots or bowlines. Tucking loose ends or tying backup 
knots is neither a substitute for, nor a necessary supplement to a clean, well-dressed 
knot. The AMGA does not recommend a backup to a figure 8 knot because this makes it 
harder to visually inspect the knot during preclimb checks. In this case, retying the quad 
or simply trimming the long tails would have prevented a potentially fatal accident.

Sean McLane (34) was on lead near the top of the second pitch when the

“It had been warm for a couple of days, and this was to be my last climb of the 
season. We were a group of three. Meg was experienced and a regular climbing 
partner of mine. Anne was new and had climbed a couple of times with Meg.” 
McLane led the first pitch and brought the other two up. 
“The second pitch was an ice column that formed at the lip of a cave. It was 40 
feet high, 60 feet wide, and 15 feet in diameter. I saw no signs of instability. I didn’t 
see or hear any significant running 
water. There was little to no cone at 
the bottom, although a 15-foot radius 
of ice was present on the ground at 
the base. I stomped on it to test for 
anything being undercut, but it felt 
solid, likely because it was a couple 
feet thick and my weight wasn’t 
enough to stress it.

pictures. As I was nearly topping out, 
there was a significant density change 
in the ice. It went from wet, one-swing 
sticks to dense, dinner-plating hits.” 
McLane climbed above the point 
where the ice was attached to the rock. 
As he swung an ice tool into an already 
dinner-plated placement, the pillar 
fractured, breaking two or three feet 
below the point of the pick’s impact. 
According to McLane, the collapse 
took “my other tool and both my feet

the pillar, and Anne was to the side. 
Most of the column went downhill, but 
falling ice buried Meg.”

McLane fell when the pillar collapsed. He recalls, “I had placed screws in the pillar

ice. This broke my spine at L2. That was my only injury besides scrapes and bruises.

cell service was driving distance away. I showed Anne how to fix a rappel line [to 
descend the first pitch]. I then gave her my phone and told her where to find my 
car keys. I took her light puffy to lie on. (I was only wearing a base layer and a hard 
shell.) Anne drove to town and contacted SAR and local ice climbers. About six hours 
after the collapse, some Salt Lake climbing friends got up to me. They moved me to 
where I could be long-lined off. The helicopter brought me to the road, where I was 
loaded into another helicopter and taken to the hospital in Salt Lake.” McLane has

ANALYSIS
Ice climbing is perhaps one of the most dangerous of climbing games. As described 
above, frozen water is a fickle, ever-changing medium, and the hazards are often 
invisible. On Raven Falls, McLane—a very experienced climber who had safely 
climbed the route twice previously—visually assessed the ice and stomp-tested the 
base to ensure the column was attached. He wrote to A NAC that, “in retrospect, 
to fail as it did, the pillar must have been melted out from underneath.” The solid-
looking column was “basically a free-hanging, bus-sized chunk of ice.” 
McLane notes:
• Running water underneath an ice formation can turn a solid and fully attached 
flow free-hanging and unstable. Figuring out if ice is undercut can be hard 
to impossible to do without seeing the running water or the gap between the 
bottom of the pillar and the base. Several days of warmer temperatures can 
create this dangerous situation.
------------------------------
to impossible to do without seeing the running water or the gap between the 
bottom of the pillar and the base. Several days of warmer temperatures can 
create this dangerous situation.
• Large variations in ice quality and density on the route may signal stability issues.
• Create a large margin when positioning oneself at the base of an ice route in 
order to stay out of the way of falling ice. A cave is not necessarily protected if 
the ice collapses.
• Carry an extra layer. Since it was a warm day, I left my puffy at the base a pitch 
below. I got very cold lying on ice and not moving for many hours.
• Carry a rescue communicator (inReach) on your person—don’t leave it at the 
base of a multi-pitch route. I now carry one on my harness or backpack strap. 
(We didn’t have one on that day, but it would have been at the base if we had.)

FATAL ROCKFALL
Big Cottonwood Canyon, Storm Mountain Island 
On May 12 at 7 p.m., Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Search and Rescue was called out for 
two injured rock climbers in Big Cottonwood Canyon. A party of two was climbing 
Goodro’s Wall (5.10c) at Storm Mountain Island when a large rock near the start of 
the route gave way. 
The rockfall seriously injured one climber and killed the belayer. Salt Lake 
County SAR responded along with Unified Fire, Unified Police, AirMed, and Utah 
Department of Public Safety. Due to the location of the patients, a technical lowering 
system was set up and the surviving patient was brought down to the parking lot and 
flown by AirMed to the hospital.

ANALYSIS
After the accident, Salt Lake County SAR noted that Goodro’s is a well-traveled route 
that was first climbed more than 70 years ago. But, they warned, after the accident 
that, “due to the wet, cool winter and spring this season, people need to be aware 
for the potential of loose rock even in well-traveled areas. Climbers also need to be 
in the habit of tapping potentially loose holds with their palm or knuckle. A hollow 
sound will tell you to proceed with caution. The rock that killed the belayer was 
covered with many years’ accumulation of chalk. Beware holds marked with a chalk 
“X .” (Source: Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Search and Rescue and the Editors.)

FATAL FALL ON ROCK
Big Cottonwood Canyon, JHCOB Wall 
On May 24, Ephraim Cook (25) fell off the last pitch of Outside Corner (3 pitches, 
5.7), a traditional route in Big Cottonwood Canyon. Though he had placed five pieces 
of gear on the pitch, he fell approximately 100 feet and hit a ledge below. 
Although the cause of the accident is not known, a police spokesperson said that 
Cook was properly equipped. The climber’s girlfriend made a frantic call to police, 
alerting them of the fall. However, when crews arrived, the man was already deceased.
Cook’s friend Zac Pond said in Climbing magazine, “My best guess... is that he 
made it through the difficult section, placing a reasonable amount of gear, then got 
up into the easier terrain, where there’s unobvious options for gear, and decided to 
run it out quite a bit.”

GROUND FALL | Inadequate Knot
Maple Canyon, Pipeline 
In June, my party of four arrived at the Pipeline in Maple Canyon to find a party 
of two—a 20-year-old male and a 25-year-old male—already climbing. One of the 
boys reported that he had just flashed a 5.12c/d. Their combination of strength and 
inexperience concerned me.
The 25-year-old started up a steep 5.11d. He made a difficult move at the fourth 
bolt and fell. My wife watched, waiting for the rope to catch. Instead, the climber 
pancaked flat onto his back from about 20 feet. The rope hung uselessly through the 
quickdraws, detached from his harness. Writhing on the ground, the fallen climber 
said, “I forgot to check my knot!”

Thankfully, two of my friends are WFR-certified. They ran to the fallen climber 
and kept him from getting up. They stabilized his back and neck and sent me to call 
911. (Verizon has service at the outhouse near Left Fork in the canyon.) By the time 
I returned, two ER doctors, who happened to be climbing nearby, had joined the 
rescue. They performed a spinal examination. The Sanpete County EMTs arrived 
after about 25 minutes. They gave the patient IV pain meds, put him in a body 
splint, and extracted him less than an hour after he’d fallen—impressive work for a 
small-town operation. 
Later, we talked to the belayer. The fallen climber had tied the rope to his 
belay loop with an overhand knot to “hold” the rope while he stick-clipped the 
first two bolts. After chatting and lacing up his shoes, he started climbing.

When he fell, the overhand caught for a millisecond before untying, dropping 
him to the ground. 
Last that we heard, the fallen climber was experiencing lower back pain but 
hadn’t broken his back, as we’d feared. Had he flashed the route and tried to 
lower from the top, he likely would’ve died or been severely injured. His head (no 
helmet) landed within a foot of a suitcase-sized boulder. He was extremely lucky.
 
ANALYSIS
This accident could have been avoided if 1) the climber and belayer had performed 
a simple partner check before leaving the ground, and 2) the climber had never tied 
the rope to himself while stick-clipping. 
I don’t know if the fallen climber invented this practice or if he learned it from

STRANDED | Stuck Rappel Ropes
Castle Valley, Castleton Tower 
On December 7, a party of two (ages 25 and 26) climbed the North Chimney (4 
pitches, 5.9) on Castleton Tower. Person 1 had three years of climbing experience 
but was a novice trad leader. Person 2 was a novice. The team brought two 70-meter 
ropes to descend the standard North Face rappel route. Around 4:30 p.m., the team 
found the rappel anchors. Concerned about the unusual size of the rappel rings, they 
tied the two ropes together with a large flat figure-8, backed up with an overhand 
bend with three-foot-long tails. The 
unusually large knot was intended to 
prevent the rope from pulling through 
the rappel rings. 
Each climber did a double-rope 
rappel using an ATC-style device. 
Unfortunately, the large knot at the 
anchor became trapped when it squeezed

Unfortunately, the large knot at the 
anchor became trapped when it squeezed 
through one of the rappel rings. The 
party tried pulling in both directions and 
whipping the ropes from side to side, but 
it would not budge. The sun was setting 
with the party stranded midway up the 
tower. They had headlamps, semi-warm 
clothes, and cell service, but neither 
knew how to ascend the ropes. The 
nighttime forecast was in the 20s, with 
possible precipitation. The team decided 
to call 911 for rescue at 5:20 p.m.
The weather conditions allowed four 
rescuers to be flown to the summit. 
The climbers’ ropes were found stuck 
between the two top rappel rings. One 
rescuer descended to assist the climbers to the ground. They were able to walk out.

Unfortunately, the wind picked up, preventing the helicopter from retrieving the 
remaining rescue team from the summit. The stranded rescuers rappelled the tower 
in strong winds with poor visibility. Once they were on the ground, the winds briefly 
died, allowing them to be flown out. They returned to base around 3:30 a.m.
ANALYSIS
Guidebook and local wisdom identify the North Face rappels as the best descent option 
on Castleton because they tend to be less crowded than the south-side rappels. The 
sheer face is also less likely to snag ropes. That said, access to the rappel rings requires 
an awkward transition from the flat tower top to a hanging position below the anchors. 
It is possible the knot got stuck between the rings as a climber was transitioning over 
the edge, while they were rappelling, or if one strand for some reason was pulled more 
than the other. While initiating a rappel, it is prudent to double-check your systems,

The summit station on Castleton’s North Face 
rappel route features unusual four-inch-
diameter rings that dangle over an abrupt

VERMONT    I    87   
A strong, simple knot, like a flat overhand, takes little rope, is easy to assess, 
and avoids snagging when the rope is pulled. Knowing how to ascend a rope with 
commonplace trad gear like slings and carabiners is a basic and essential traditional 
climbing skill.  
As a side note, these large rappel rings have contributed to several incidents in 
recent years (see ANAC 2022 for one). Local volunteers have plans to replace these 
four-inch-diameter rings with standard rappel rings. (Sources: Person 1, Person 2,

Pellett wrote to A NAC:
“That morning, I rappelled from a tree to a flat dish, where one could easily stand. 
There I installed a two-bolt anchor on a route I had rehearsed on top-rope then soloed 
the year before. I drilled the anchor, equipped it with locking carabiners on a pre-tied 
quad, clipped in with a PAS, and then pulled my rope from the tree above. I was in a bit 
of a hurry. Weather was coming in, and I was eager to get the route installed.”
Pellett then fixed his rope to the anchor. “I took an end of the rope, tied a figure-8, and 
clipped it to the quad. The end that I clipped to the quad had a 15-to-20-foot-long tail, 
something I always try to avoid. The other end of the 60-meter 9.5mm rope lay spread out 
down the slab, as friction kept it from sliding fully to the ground 100 feet below.

“I put an ATC Guide on the rope and backed it up with a Klemheist knot that was 
clipped to my leg loop. I slipped on my rock shoes, clipped my equipment to my harness, 
and began rappelling. I assumed I had 150 feet of rope to work with and was not 
planning to rappel more than 30 feet at first (in order to assess where to place a bolt). I 
never double-checked anything or bothered to tie a backup knot as I was sure the rope 
would more than easily reach the ground.  
“Unknowingly, I had clipped into the short tail of rope instead of the long strand. 
Two seconds after I started rappelling, I felt the end of the rope pass through my backup 
knot. I had just enough time to look up at my extended rappel device and watch the rope

“I began falling down the slab. I dropped to my hands, toes, and belly in a futile 
effort to stop as I began sliding faster.  On the way down, I caught my feet on a small, 
sloping dike and attempted to toss myself past it to avoid breaking a leg and /or wrecking 
my knees. Tumbling and sliding as the slab eased, I came to a halt five feet above the 
ground. Screaming from pain and fear, I butt-slid down the low-angle slab to the ground. 
I had bruised and bloody elbows, hands, and knees. I was wearing a helmet, and a few 
days later I found deep gouges in its left side. I had clearly hit my head and perhaps slid 
on it for a bit. I do not recall, but I’m pretty sure it saved me from a bad head injury.

Lack of attention is at the heart of many climbing accidents. In Pellett’s case, 
distraction, complacency, and hurry caused him to deviate from his usual practice of 
properly dressing his figure-8. This misstep, along with a failure to perform his usual 
double-checks, led to this near-fatal accident. As Pellett recalls:
“Leaving a tail longer than three feet was something I’ve avoided in over 30 
years of climbing. After several outings of installing bolts and anchors, I had become 
very comfortable running around on these low-angle slabs. My mother had died two 
weeks prior to the accident, and I was often filled with grief. Being up on a cliff was 
good medicine for that new hole in my heart. I guess I didn’t realize how distracted I

AVAL ANC HE | Inexperience, Inadequate Gear
Stuart Range, Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Colchuck Peak 
At 1:15 p.m. on February 19, a slab avalanche killed three climbers: Seong Cho (54), 
Jeannie Lee (60), and Yun Park (66). They were attempting the Northeast Couloir of 
Colchuck Peak in a team of six when the avalanche occurred. 
At the time of the accident, the team was traveling unroped on the 1,500-foot, 
Grade II snow climb. Reports indicate the slab avalanche was triggered by the lead 
climber and entrained four of the five climbers below. The slide carried the climbers 
approximately 500 feet down the narrow 
couloir. All of the falling climbers remained 
on the surface but sustained traumatic 
injuries. Unfortunately, for three of the 
climbers, those injuries proved fatal. The 
surviving climber, with lower-extremity 
injuries, was assisted 1,000 feet down to 
the team’s base camp by the remaining two 
team members.

moderate to strong westerly winds. On the morning of the 19th, the party reported 
light snowfall, becoming heavier as they ascended. An incoming winter storm began to

This team of climbers had been in the field, without communications devices, for 
multiple days and did not have access to this report. Based on subsequent interviews, 
none of the climbers was wearing an avalanche beacon nor had received formal 
avalanche training. Three of the four climbers who were caught and carried were 
not wearing helmets. The survivor was wearing a helmet. While it is not certain how 
helmets influenced the result of this incident, wearing a helmet provides additional 
protection against traumatic brain injuries.

I am a slow hiker, so we had planned to take all day to get over the pass. 
We were delayed over an hour administering first aid to a hiker near Colchuck 
Lake. Because of this, we started ascending the pass much later than planned. We 
reached the sketchy part at 6:35 p.m. We donned Microspikes and helmets and got 
our ice axes out. 
The tricky section required a traverse of ten feet across 40° rock, covered with a 
thin layer of ice, and then a short step up. Below this section was a steep snowfield 
ending in jagged talus. Tyler was more experienced and went first. I saw one of his 
feet slip, but he recovered. 
When it was my turn, I was anxious but never thought I would actually fall. My 
ice axe spike broke the thin ice off, exposing wet rock. My Microspikes did not stick

grip the rock better or just keep going—I left my spikes on. I made sure to use my ice 
axe for stability, but in the same spot as Tyler, I slipped and started sliding. 
I was oriented feet-first, with my stomach down. I hit the steep (40°) snow, got 
my axe oriented correctly to arrest, but was sliding very fast due to my heavy pack 
and the slick snow. I tried to push my shoulder further down onto the ice axe, but the 
next thing I knew I hit a rock and was flipping. I landed in a boulderfield on my back. 
My head must have smashed into a boulder. 
Tyler estimated I slid 50 feet into the boulderfield. I had cuts around my nose and 
eyes, bruises and cuts down my legs, and more broken bones than my doctors could

traverse would have been any better. After almost ten months of thinking about this 
daily, I think it was just an accident. I do not think I was too inexperienced. We made 
good decisions like having first-aid supplies and training, carrying an inReach, and 
having the right tools to climb snow. Experience told us to be safe and put helmets 
on. All these factors probably saved my life. (Source: Jessi.)
FATAL SOLO FALL 
Snoqualmie Pass Area, The Tooth 
On August 16, a 35-year-old female climber attempted a solo climb of the Tooth near 
Snoqualmie Pass. She shared an inReach tracking link with two close friends upon 
leaving the trailhead.
The climber successfully climbed the South Face Route (330 feet, 5.4) and texted 
photos from the summit around 6:30 p.m. After leaving the summit, she traveled

north and somehow fell from the ridge between the Tooth and the Fang (an adjacent 
summit due north). She fell 600 feet to the toe of the Northeast Slabs route. The climber 
was wearing approach shoes and a helmet, and had worn rock shoes during the ascent. 
One of the people with the inReach tracking information called SAR late that 
evening after the climber failed to return home and did not respond to phone or 
inReach messaging. It was also clear from the inReach track that she would have had 
enough time to return to the trailhead but had not. 
A SAR team hiked in the next morning and located the climber’s body by 7:40 
a.m. using GPS points and drone support. The climber had succumbed to injuries 
from the long fall. The SAR team extracted the body using a helicopter.
ANALYSIS
Unroped scrambling is inherently risky. The Tooth is a volcanic rock formation, and 
rock quality varies significantly.

ANALYSIS
Unroped scrambling is inherently risky. The Tooth is a volcanic rock formation, and 
rock quality varies significantly.
The North Ridge (4th class) is the preferred descent for unroped climbers, but 
judging from where she came to rest, it was not possible for her to have fallen from 
that route. Those close to the climber knew she loved traversing ridgelines and was 
looking for an after-work loop, close to Seattle. An inReach GPS point was sent at 
6:55 p.m. from atop the ridge. The next, at 8:05 p.m., was at the bottom of the NE 
slabs. Sunset on August 16 was 8:18 p.m. Thus, it is likely that, given the daylight 
remaining, she left the North Ridge descent and crossed onto the ridge between the 
Tooth and the Fang, with the intent of traversing farther, before descending easy 
terrain to the west.

The exact cause of her fall is unknown, but loose rock is most likely. When 
traversing exposed terrain, there is little room for error and caution must be taken 
to avoid brittle rock and fragile holds. The climber had traversed similar terrain 
many times and was someone who navigated chossy rock with ease. Her accident 
was a shock and a reminder that casual mountain outings can be as deadly as more 
foreboding objectives. (Sources: A close climbing partner of the decedent, Seattle 
Mountain Rescue, and Portland Mountain Rescue.)
The Tooth is one of the most popular summits in the Cascades and was the scene of a fatal solo

FALL ON ROCK | Carabiner Cut Rope
Monongahela National Forest, Seneca Rocks 
On August 5, a party of two started up Simple J Malarkey (3 pitches, 5.7). The top of the 
second pitch ends in a corner alcove with overhanging rock above. At the start of the 
third pitch, the leader, Danny Gerhart (24), placed a 0.75 Camalot just above the belay, 
before attempting to climb up and left. The leader encountered a wasp’s nest and stepped 
back down to the belay. He then stepped 
down and to the right on the ramp that 
ends the second pitch. This was the 
sequence most used by other climbers.
Gerhart was now about five feet 
away from the belay. He placed a 
second 0.75 Camalot before moving 
up and left to a second alcove, about 
eight feet above and to the right of the 
belay. Here, Gerhart placed a number 
3 Camalot in a shallow, slightly flaring

eight feet above and to the right of the 
belay. Here, Gerhart placed a number 
3 Camalot in a shallow, slightly flaring 
pocket. (This piece was found with 
both extended and non-extended 
alpine draws attached.) At this point, 
he removed the second 0.75 Camalot to 
prevent excessive rope drag.
Gerhart attempted to move up and 
right from this stance, which is on route. 
This crux section requires the leader to 
move out over a roof on a four-foot-high 
plaque of rock. Though protection is 
available, the leader cannot see it until 
they have committed to the crux, and 
even then, the placement is behind the 
climber and at waist level. The handholds 
here could be described as less than 
inspiring, as water drains onto them 
from above, adding a polished feel to 
the rock. Having found no gear, Gerhart 
stepped back down to the previous stance 
and discussed options with the belayer.

By then, the sun was peeking over the top, making route-finding more difficult. The 
climbing team discussed options before Gerhart decided to move up and left.
Climbing above the last piece and not finding additional protection, Gerhart 
called down to the belayer, informing them that he was going to take a deliberate 
fall (acknowledging it was “going to be a big one”). He then let go and fell around 
12 feet before loading the rope. The belayer reported having enough time to 
In this highly unusual accident, the carabiner

take in two to four feet of slack before hearing a very loud “gunshot” as the rope 
exploded. The belayer never felt the falling climber load the belay, and Gerhart fell 
approximately 130 feet to the ground.  
While numerous climbing parties immediately responded to give aid, the fallen 
climber passed at the scene.
Evidence points to the rope being cut by the carabiner on the extended alpine 
draw attached to the number 3 Camalot. The carabiner remained attached to the fully 
extended alpine draw and was found lying on a slabby portion of rock just below the 
Camalot. Fuzzy remains from the rope sheath were found inside the carabiner. No rope 
sheath material was found on any nearby rock edges or the slabby rock face.

Photos from the accident scene show about seven feet of rope extending from 
the tie-in on Gerhart’s harness. Three to four feet of core was exposed where the 
rope cut. The individual core bundles 
were all severed at the same length; 
this indicates a definitive “cut” versus 
extended shredding over an edge.
ANALYSIS
How the carabiner cut the rope is 
difficult to visualize. But here is my 
attempt to explain it.
The rope leaving the belayer moved 
up through the first piece and past the 
slightly overhanging rock above. The 
overhang included a six-to-eight-inch-
wide V-slot that likely inhibited the 
belay strand from moving laterally to 
the right. At the time of impact, the 
belay strand of the rope would have 
been lying on the slabby rock face 
above before entering the backside 
of the carabiner, which in turn was 
clipped to the extended draw and 
number 3 Camalot. In the same way

of the carabiner, which in turn was 
clipped to the extended draw and 
number 3 Camalot. In the same way 
the load strand in an ATC Guide locks 
down on the belay strand, so did the 
leader’s end of the rope. It wrapped 
around the carabiner, crushing down 
on the belay strand and the rock below it, and thus focusing the entire load of the 
fall onto the small section of rope between Gerhart and the cam. 
In essence, Gerhart took a factor-two fall onto the carabiner. In fact, he may have 
achieved something greater than a factor-two fall, as the pinched rope effectively 
reduced the rope in the system to around six feet. I’ll leave it up to someone more 
qualified to calculate the force load of a climber falling an estimated 9 to 11 feet on 
around six feet of rope and all that energy being applied at the bend at the carabiner 
and onto the belay strand. Needless to say, it was enough to instantly sever the rope.

One tragic fact: It’s quite possible that Gerhart’s extended sling may have perfectly 
positioned the carabiner at the time the piece was placed, but then tragically the 
carabiner shifted into the fateful position. Had the carabiner been just two inches to 
the left or right, it would no longer have been lying on rock but hanging in free space. 
Would extending the sling on the first piece Gerhart placed have changed the location 
of the carabiner in question at the time of impact? This is unknown, as the first piece 
was ultimately removed by the belayer before they rappelled to the ground, so we were 
not able to replicate exactly how the rope was running.  
Apart from the fact that Gerhart was off route at the time of the accident, this 
was, in my opinion, a freak accident. Two inches of movement in the carabiner 
could have made the difference between life and death. (Source: Arthur Kearns,

HIGH ALTITUDE PULMONARY EDEMA 
Grand Teton National Park, Mt. Owen 
At 5 a.m. on June 13, NPS personnel received an emergency notification from a 
climbing party descending the Koven Route (3,000 feet, 5.4) on Mt. Owen (12,933 
feet). A 57-year-old male climber was showing signs of high altitude illness (HAI) 
and extreme fatigue. The climber was also hypothermic. The climbing party had 
started the day at 2 a.m. on June 12 and summited at 3 p.m. They had weathered a 
significant snowstorm while descending.
NPS climbing rangers were dispatched to rendezvous with the patient and 
assist him to the trailhead. The rescuers arrived at the climbing party’s bivy site 
at Amphitheater Lake at 9:20 a.m. They spent considerable time evaluating the 
patient and rewarming him with dry clothing, drinks, and food. At 10:30 a.m.,

at Amphitheater Lake at 9:20 a.m. They spent considerable time evaluating the 
patient and rewarming him with dry clothing, drinks, and food. At 10:30 a.m., 
the patient was able to start down toward the trailhead. However, his condition 
continued to deteriorate and he began exhibiting signs and symptoms of high 
altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). An NPS litter team was deployed, and they 
carried the patient the remaining 1.5 miles to the Lupine Meadows trailhead, from 
which he was transferred by ambulance to the hospital.
ANALYSIS
Although altitude illness is less common in the Tetons than in other North American 
ranges, the elevations of many peaks in Grand Teton National Park are sufficient to 
cause HAI. Mild to moderate HAI is often referred to as acute mountain sickness (AMS). 
The severe forms of HAI include high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and HAPE. If left 
untreated, these illnesses can worsen and even be fatal.
------------------------------
The severe forms of HAI include high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and HAPE. If left 
untreated, these illnesses can worsen and even be fatal.      
The management of HAPE involves immediate descent, supplemental oxygen, and 
specific emergency medications (see page 11). Of these, descent is the most important. 
But even with these treatments, as this case illustrates, ill climbers can continue to 
deteriorate during evacuation. Climbers should be familiar with the signs and symptoms 
of HAI and react early. (Source: Grand Teton National Park Search and Rescue Report.)

Grand Teton National Park, Teewinot Mountain 
On July 14 at 3:45 p.m., NPS personnel received a cell phone call from two young 
climbers stuck on Teewinot (12,330 feet). The male climbers, aged 19 and 20 years, 
reported that they were on a snowfield north of the Idol and Worshipper rock 
formations. They were carrying ice axes but did not know how to use them. They also 
reported that the snow was soft and they were unable to descend any further. The 
incident commander coached them on proper descent practices. The climbers then 
reported over the phone that, despite this assistance, they still needed a rescue. 
Two NPS climbing rangers were deployed, and rescuers got to the stranded 
climbers at 6 p.m. The distressed climbers were lowered on rope systems until they

Last year, Grand Teton National Park was the eighth-most-visited U.S. national park. The year 2023 
also saw a disturbing trend in which technical climbs were listed on popular hiking-specific apps. This 
contributed to several rescues and a fatality. Photo of the Grand Teton by Acroterion | Wikimedia

WYOMING    I    97   
ANALYSIS
There have been multiple similar instances of climbers in the Tetons being 
unprepared for their objectives, both during 2023 and in previous seasons. The 
summer climbing season in the range often starts with snow-covered peaks and ends 
with nearly exclusive rock climbing terrain. During transition periods, climbers need 
to be prepared for the current conditions and not the ideal conditions. 
In recent seasons, rangers have noticed an increase in technical climbing routes 
being listed on hiking-specific applications and websites. Many 4th- and 5th-class 
rock climbs with high risk and fall potential are listed incorrectly as hikes. Climbers 
are reminded to gather their route information from fellow climbers and climbing-
specific resources. (Source: Grand Teton National Park Search and Rescue Report.)

CLIMBING FALL | Probable Verglas
Grand Teton National Park, Grand Teton 
On July 20, the NPS received a cell phone call reporting that a 41-year-old male 
climber had fallen and was unresponsive. The injured climber had been leading 
the Owen Chimney feature (5.5) on the Grand Teton (13,770 feet) and had fallen 
ten minutes prior. The patient, who was wearing a climbing helmet, had been 
placing a piece of protection when his foot slipped, resulting in a tumbling fall to 
the belay ledge.
The patient had sustained a head injury, had dilated pupils, and had 
intermittent breathing. The incident commander relayed initial instructions 
including rolling the patient on his side, opening and clearing his airway, 
monitoring his breathing and pulse, and keeping the patient warm. At 11:46 a.m.,

NPS personnel requested the park’s contract helicopter to assist in the rescue. At 
11:47 a.m., the reporting climber stated that he was starting cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (CPR). 
At 12:29 p.m., the party informed the NPS that the patient was still 
unresponsive, had slow breathing and a pulse, significant bleeding in his mouth, 
and fixed and dilated pupils. The helicopter departed the Lupine Meadows rescue 
cache with two rangers at 12:55 p.m. 
Unfortunately, at 1 p.m., the reporting party informed NPS personnel that, 
following 20 minutes of sustained CPR, the patient had died from his injuries. 
The first ranger arrived by short-haul at 1:20 p.m. and confirmed the death of 
the climber. A second ranger arrived on scene via short-haul at 1:40 p.m. and 
extracted the deceased climber’s son. The first ranger remained on scene with 
the climbing partner and began an accident investigation.

ANALYSIS
This team had done many things correctly. They allotted extra time for poor conditions 
or weather. They researched their route, both at home and at the ranger station. On the 
day of the accident, the climbers got an early start and progressed reasonably well. They 
were prepared for the dry conditions reported by others who had descended the previous 
day. However, on many alpine routes, daily freeze-thaw cycles can coat rock in thin ice 
(verglas) during the early morning hours. The thin ice was reported in the chimney on 
July 20 and might have caused the deceased climber’s foot to slip.

98  I  ACCIDENTS IN NORTH AMERICAN CLIMBING 2024
A fall in non-vertical terrain can have worse outcomes than similar falls in 
steeper terrain. Per reports, the climber tumbled 40 to 50 feet. This climber was 
wearing a helmet, but it appears that multiple impacts during the tumbling fall 
broke the helmet and likely caused further injury. 
Following efforts to save this climber’s life, two climbing partners were still at 
the scene. It is important to acknowledge the transition from rescue of the patient 
to rescue of the partners. First, rescuers should address basic needs such as warmth 
and hunger. Rescuers should be diligent in psychological care for the survivors. 
The NPS personnel involved in this incident reported spending the majority of 
their efforts directed at the care of the two survivors. (Source: Grand Teton National

ROCKFALL AND SHORTCUTS 
Multiple Incidents and Locations 
The 2023 Teton climbing season saw several incidents involving rockfall and climbers 
taking shortcuts. 
One incident occurred on July 30, involving a 26-year-old female climber

after being hit by rockfall while on a shortcut from the main couloir to the south fork 
of Garnet Canyon. This is a common shortcut used to avoid traveling to the lowest 
part of the saddle to the south of the Middle Teton. The terrain is steeper and holds 
more loose rock than the descent to the saddle proper. A similar incident occurred on 
September 8 when a 65-year-old male climber fell while also shortcutting the same 
exit.  Unfortunately, this climber was deceased by the time rescue personnel were 
notified that he had not returned from his planned ascent.  
Another rockfall incident occurred in the afternoon of August 11. A 35-year-old 
male climber was hit by falling rocks while on the Owen-Spalding rappels. Thankfully, 
before NPS arrived, guides and climbers in the vicinity were able to assist the climber,

who was suffering from an altered mental status.  
On August 26, a member of a team attempting the traverse from Teewinot to Mt. 
Owen dislodged a boulder, hitting his 37-year-old male partner. The boulder impacted 
the climber’s lower left leg, and the resulting closed injury showed signs of early 
compartment syndrome and prevented the climber from walking. Weather prevented 
a rescue directly from the scene. A climbing ranger was inserted along the ridge to the 
west at 12:33 p.m. The ranger and climbing partner were able to move the patient to a 
lower elevation with flyable weather.
ANALYSIS
The similar nature of these incidents caught the attention of climbing rangers.

primary routes. (Source: Grand Teton National Park Search and Rescue Report.)

After a helicopter reconnaissance, given the late hour and waning daylight, 
the decision was made to send a ground team to assist the stranded climbers. 
Four climbing rangers were deployed at 10:30 p.m., and they arrived on scene at 
2:15 a.m. and spent the rest of the night with the climbers. During the morning of 
August 11, three helicopter shuttles brought the rescuers and climbers back to the

ANALYSIS
Several factors contributed to this unfortunate accident. 
• Late Start. The team started their ascent in the afternoon, well after most 
would recommend. An NPS volunteer who was descending the peak at 2 p.m. 
informed the team of the lateness of their ascent and that other climbers 
were already descending from the summit. The volunteer also pointed out 
their lack of necessary equipment to safely continue. Despite this, the team

were already descending from the summit. The volunteer also pointed out 
their lack of necessary equipment to safely continue. Despite this, the team 
continued up.
• Large Team. Having nine climbers in the group likely contributed to this 
accident. Larger teams always move slower than smaller teams, as rest breaks 
and decision-making can be prolonged.
• Use of Hiking Apps. This team relied on information taken from a popular 
hiking application, as previously discussed in this section. This climb, in 
particular, is listed on several platforms as a hike (see page 96). Interviews 
with survivors revealed they were under the impression that the East Face of 
Teewinot was a traditional hike. It is a 5th-class climb. (Source: Grand Teton

On the morning of July 10, Mac Taylor (25) fell on the first pitch of Gunky (2 
pitches, 5.8). He wrote the following account for A NAC:
Two friends and I hiked to the base of Gunky at the Sandstone Buttress. I was 
new to the area. We hiked with gear on our harnesses while carrying ropes and a 
bag with water and extra gear. I decided to lead the first pitch, despite being told 
that there was a scary roof section. Part of the reason I chose to lead it was that I 
already had most of the gear racked on my harness. On the route, I placed a large 
nut and a number 1 Camalot. I then clipped a bolt and placed a 0.75 Camalot in a 
shallow slot deep in the crack I was climbing. 
Halfway up the pitch, I rested and placed a number 2 Camalot deep in an 
offwidth-sized crack. I laybacked the crack and got established below the roof.

From there, I struggled to find comfortable holds. I was about ten feet above my 
last piece. 
I decided to backtrack. My belayer was pulling in slack while I downclimbed. 
About five feet above my last piece, I fell. My hands slipped first, and my feet 
were still on the wall. I flipped upside down and pulled two pieces. The number 2 
was a good placement, but it was placed straight in the crack, not oriented in the 
direction of the fall. It levered out and tweaked the cam lobes. The 0.75 just pulled 
out. I was caught by the bolt after falling 30 feet. My belayer was yanked up then

dropped back to the ground as the last piece pulled. This resulted in bruising on 
their elbows and lower back. I split my lip, sprained my ankle, and cut up my left 
forearm, with heavy bruising on the right side of my abdomen from my harness. 
I had stopped right before hitting a ledge. I was lowered to our belay stance, 
a very large ledge above a slabby wall. My belayer ran down to the car to grab 
my first-aid kit while I lay on the ground. In the parking lot was an AMGA guide 
who was also a Wilderness Emergency Medical Technician (WEMT). With their 
help, we put gauze on my bleeding arm and my lip. We also put a SAM Splint 
on my ankle. Rather than navigate the entire approach, the guide lowered me 
down the slabby wall. I walked out with the help of my friends, and we went to

was the hardest trad climb I would have done up to that time. I definitely should 
have let a friend lead this pitch while I took the second, less scary pitch. I also 
really thought I had placed some good pieces on the climb. I should go back and 
practice my placements more and get some critical feedback from someone more 
experienced.” (Source: Mac Taylor.)

passive gear on routes like Gunky might be safer and can teach or reinforce basic 
protection principles. Kyle Williams on Mountain Project wrote that Gunky “can be

Taylor became fatigued: “Place it before going over.... Just drop it in, tug it, and go.”
Gunky is a popular route in Sinks Canyon that protects well with hexes and nuts. Familiarity with 
passive gear and more cam-placing skills might have helped prevent an accident that occurred in

FROSTBITE | Fatigue, Lack of Hydration and Nutrition
Yukon, Kluane National Park and Reserve, Mt. Logan 
In late May, a group of three was attempting to climb King Trench (aka King’s 
Trench), the most frequented route up Mt. Logan (5,959 meters). Mt. Logan is the 
highest peak in Canada. This area of Kluane National Park and Reserve (KNPR) 
is known for harsh weather and its remote locale. The nearest airstrip is 150 
kilometers away. King Trench is a ski-mountaineering objective that includes 
complex glacier travel. It takes most parties two to three weeks to complete, 
depending on weather and speed of acclimatization.
This group was at a high camp known as the Football Field (4,900 meters), 
generally the final camp before a summit attempt. Summit day is a committing

generally the final camp before a summit attempt. Summit day is a committing 
18-kilometer round trip. It requires climbers to go up and over Prospector’s Col 
(about 5,400 meters) and make a long traverse of the summit plateau to reach the 
top. Summit day requires excellent weather to complete safely.  
The group of three had been stuck in bad weather for several days. As the 
weather started to clear late in the day on May 28, the team decided to make 
Mt. Logan (foreground) from the north. Teams entering the St. Elias Mountains must be self-
sufficient. Logan can go for years without a successful ascent. The King Trench route, scene of a

a resupply trip down to their food cache at King Col (about 4,100m). The team 
completed the trip and returned to high camp at 1 a.m. They were cold and 
exhausted, and immediately hopped in their sleeping bags to fall asleep. The next 
morning, one member had frostbite on most of their fingers and some of their toes. 
The climber was in pain and was unable to travel under their own power without 
causing further damage. They decided to contact KNPR Visitor Safety. 
On May 29, the Visitor Safety team was notified of the need to evacuate the 
climber. The forecast called for clearing weather the next day. Three members of 
the Visitor Safety team were on a training and acclimatization trip on Mt. Steele, 
60 kilometers northeast. Early on the morning of May 30, two helicopters picked 
up the Mt. Steele team, and they established a staging area at a base camp on 
King Trench. The weather was perfect, with clear conditions and light winds. The

King Trench. The weather was perfect, with clear conditions and light winds. The 
forecast called for a chance of afternoon buildup, so there was some urgency to 
complete the rescue early in the day. 
The team did a recon of the rescue site and prepared to heli-sling a rescuer to 
the Football Field. A heli-sling rescue involves attaching a rescuer to the helicopter 
with a 30-meter line and flying suspended below the aircraft. This allows the 
helicopter to fly in clearer air and avoid a risky landing at high altitude. 
The climbing party was told to dress the injured climber in their warmest 
clothes, cover all exposed skin, and prepare them to be quickly harnessed and 
clipped into the sling line. Upon arrival, a rescuer harnessed the patient and 
they were both slung down to base camp. The injured climber was assessed and

they were both slung down to base camp. The injured climber was assessed and 
transferred to a second helicopter. They were then flown to the Whitehorse 
Hospital frostbite clinic.
ANALYSIS
A heli-sling mission at 4,900 meters is near any helicopter’s altitude limit. Weather 
conditions were ideal, and the rescue team had recently completed their annual 
high-altitude heli-sling training. The rescued climber was very fortunate, crediting 
their recovery to the evacuation speed and excellent care at the Whitehorse clinic. 
The frostbitten climber had several learning points. First, the team got colder 
than anticipated during the half hour spent packing up camp at King Col. They put 
on heavy mittens to warm up, but the mittens were bulky and did not allow enough 
dexterity to keep their hands moving and blood flowing. Second, upon their return 
to camp, exhaustion drove them into their sleeping bags without taking time to

dexterity to keep their hands moving and blood flowing. Second, upon their return 
to camp, exhaustion drove them into their sleeping bags without taking time to 
eat, rehydrate, and make hot-water bottles. Although it did not feel cold enough for 
frostbite, exhaustion and altitude rendered them unaware of the cold and the rapid 
onset of frostbite.
The injured climber had moderate to severe frostbite on nine fingers and two 
toes. Thanks to efficient rescue and effective treatment, they did not require 
amputation and have retained full function. Though issues with pain and 
hypersensitivity remain, they are hopeful of improvement. 
This party was lucky to get a good weather window the day after the injury 
occurred. In this mountain range, it is not uncommon to wait for weeks for 
adequate weather conditions required to perform such a rescue. (Source: Ian

104  I  ACCIDENTS IN NORTH AMERICAN CLIMBING 2024
LEADER FALL | Off Route, Loose Rock
British Columbia, North Cascades, Chinese Puzzle Wall 
On the evening of August 31, Ines Papert and Emilie Pellerin began a six-
hour approach to the Chinese Puzzle Wall in southwestern British Columbia. 
According to Climbing.com, “Papert realized she’d forgotten her Garmin satellite 
communicator, but the pair decided to press on anyway, taking extra care to avoid 
an accident.” 
Their objective was Crouching Tiger (11 pitches, 5.12b). After a challenging 
approach including technical, wet slabs climbed while wearing heavy packs, 
the pair arrived at the base at 2 a.m. They slept for seven hours. Climbing.com 
reported, “On September 1, they put up and fixed four pitches...jugging up to tackle 
the second half of the 11-pitch line the next day.”

On September 2, they swapped leads, and completed the crux climbing by 
6:30 p.m. Climbing.com wrote, “Pellerin began leading up the ninth pitch...(and) 
realized she was likely off-route. ‘I weighed my options, knowing these last two 
pieces wouldn’t hold much more than body weight.... I figured I could pull it off. I 
did a few pretty hard moves to find nothing but a fully closed seam. This was more 
risk than I could handle.’ Pellerin downclimbed to the highest of the marginal 
pieces and asked her partner to take. As she weighted the piece, the rock ‘exploded 
in my face.’ Her two highest pieces pulled, and Pellerin took a 20- to 25-foot fall.”
Pellerin suffered a broken ankle. The pair rappelled and reached the ground at 
midnight. With a storm forecasted and Pellerin disabled, Papert decided to race to 
the road to get help. They knew that any delay would hamper air rescue.

The Chinese Puzzle Wall, illuminated above, was the scene of an iPhone SOS rescue in September 
2023. Tricky route-finding, loose rock, and pulled protection factored into an accident that struck 
two world-class climbers. On serious and remote adventure routes, some risks are unavoidable.

Climbing.com reported, “Just before Papert set off alone, Pellerin stopped her.” 
Neither had cell service, “but playing around on her phone, Pellerin had found a 
button to send an ‘Emergency Text via Satellite.’...The pair soon received a message 
from Apple’s support team. They asked her if she had an emergency contact...
and Pellerin gave the number of her partner, Ian Middleton. She was allowed...  a 
40-character message. She wrote: Call SAR broken ankle 6hour hike Slesse.”
The next few hours saw confused and frustrating attempts to communicate 
directly with SAR. Ultimately, the first message—sent to Middleton, along with the 
stranded pair’s coordinates, led to a successful rescue. At 7:45 a.m., a search and 
rescue helicopter arrived, and by 9 a.m. the pair was airlifted out. Less than two 
hours later, a four-day storm moved in.

ANALYSIS
Not having proper emergency communication was avoidable. As Papert later said, 
“I was kicking myself for not bringing an inReach.” Friends in the area had satellite 
communicators, but Papert said she was in too much of a hurry to borrow one. 
The iPhone SOS feature saved the day: Introduced in 2022, it allows simple 
satellite communication versus previous emergency messages that required a 
weak cell signal. However, this new service has its own issues. Only the iPhone 
14 and newer models, are satellite-communication capable. It only works in 16 
countries, and it does not allow a direct dialogue with SAR or a dispatcher. The 
service acts as a third party, relaying a single 40-character message to a single 
emergency contact. Though Pellerin said that the SOS feature “was so much better

LEADER FALL ON ICE | Poor Ice Conditions, Ice Dam
British Columbia, Kootenay National Park, Storm Creek 
On December 2, a climber was nearing the top of a two-pitch ice climb called Xena 
(100 meters, WI3/4) in the Storm Creek area. They traversed to establish an ice 
anchor and broke through an ice dam with their tools. The release of water pushed 
them off the route, and they fell 12 to 15 meters (40 to 50 feet), breaking their right 
leg. The belayer was also soaked and lowered the injured climber as far as possible. 
The injured climber built an ice anchor and rappelled to the top of the first pitch. 
From there, the belayer fixed a rope to and lowered the injured climber to the 
ground. They then rappelled down.
------------------------------
From there, the belayer fixed a rope to and lowered the injured climber to the

A second party nearby heard the injured party yelling and came to assist. They 
triggered their inReach SOS feature. After the patient was made as warm and 
comfortable as possible, one person ran to the parking lot for more warm clothing. 
There they met a Parks Canada warden and were informed that a rescue soon 
would be launched and they did not need to return to the climb with the clothing. 
A Visitor Safety team was slung into the rescue site by helicopter. The rescuers 
splinted the patient’s leg, packaged them in a vacuum mattress, and heli-slung 
them to a waiting ambulance at the Stanley Glacier parking lot. The patient had 
a serious tibia-fibula break, mild hypothermia, and vascular damage to a leg, and 
they experienced compartment syndrome.
------------------------------
106  I  ACCIDENTS IN NORTH AMERICAN CLIMBING 2024
ANALYSIS
While ice dams with large amounts of 
water behind them are not common 
on ice climbs, a significant number of 
people have encountered this type of 
event over the years. They generally 
form on relatively low-angle sections, 
often at the top of columns or steep ice.  
Though this hazard may be difficult 
to anticipate, it reinforces the need to 
place good and frequent protection, 
especially before topping out on a 
route, even if the terrain is easy. 
Frequent protection can help minimize 
the length of a fall and reduce the 
potential for serious injury.
The party had an inReach but 
had left it in a pack at the base of the 
route. This led to a delay in calling 
for outside resources until the second 
group of climbers arrived. In this case, 
the delay was not too significant.

group of climbers arrived. In this case, 
the delay was not too significant.  
However, with reduced daylight hours 
for helicopter response in winter, it’s 
a good idea to keep your emergency 
communication device with you while 
climbing. This will maximize the 
chances of a quick rescue and can 
improve patient outcomes.
The party was able to get the 
patient to the base of the route, which 
helped speed up the rescue. Both the 
belayer and the injured climber were 
soaked, and this led to significant heat 
loss while waiting. The group did their 
best to put packs and other insulation 
under the patient to get them off 
the cold ground. While it may not be 
practical to bring enough extra clothes and insulation to deal with an emergency, 
some form of lightweight shelter can substantially reduce heat loss and help with 
patient outcomes. The more you can insulate a patient from the cold ground, the 
better.

Sending an extra person out to get more clothing and insulation was a good 
move, despite this assistance ultimately not being needed. Had any delays in 
helicopter access occurred, the extra supplies would have made a big difference.

BENIGHTED | Underestimated Route
Alberta, Jasper National Park, Tonquin Valley, Oubliette Mlountain 
On September 3, two pairs of experienced climbers were stranded high on 
Oubliette Mountain’s east ridge (450 meters, 5.9) after inclement weather moved 
in. The two pairs spent the night in an unplanned bivouac but were prepared with 
warm clothing and emergency tarps. It rained overnight, preventing them from 
finishing the route the next day. They were too high to bail off the route, so they 
made the call to request a rescue. The four climbers were rescued by Visitor Safety 
staff via a heli-sling rescue. 
ANALYSIS

the difficulty of the climb and may have been off route briefly. They were prepared

FALL INTO CREVASSE | Unroped, Inadequate Equipment
Alberta, Banff National Park, Lower Victoria Glacier 
At 1 p.m. on September 17, a solo climber was descending Mt. Collier (3,215 meters) 
via the Collier-Victoria col. While transitioning from the rocky terrain below the 
col to icy slopes leading down to the Lower Victoria Glacier, the climber lost their 
footing and started sliding down the steep slope. After 80 meters, the climber 
disappeared into an open crevasse approximately 2.5 meters wide, on lower-angle 
terrain. Fortunately, the incident was witnessed by an Association of Canadian 
Mountain Guides (ACMG) guide from the top of the Collier-Victoria col. The guide 
immediately called Parks Canada via satellite phone and initiated a rescue.

The guide (with two clients) made their way down to the point where the fallen 
climber was last seen. The climber had fallen 25 meters into the crevasse and 
stopped on a small snow bridge. Surprisingly, they were not badly hurt. The guide 
rappelled down and secured the climber to the wall of the crevasse. As the Parks 
Canada rescue team arrived, the guide was just returning to the surface. A rescuer 
was lowered into the crevasse, and the fallen climber was raised using a twin rope 
system. The patient was mildly hypothermic and had only some minor cuts and 
lacerations. The climber was evacuated to a staging area using a helicopter long-
line and then flown to a waiting ambulance in Lake Louise.

ANALYSIS
Although the climber seemed to have had some experience, they were not equipped 
with crampons, an ice axe, a harness, or a helmet. It is believed the climber 
ascended Mt. Collier via a rock scramble route on the east face, but chose to 
descend via the Collier-Victoria col. Although this descent option is relatively easy, 
it involves negotiating steep snow and ice slopes. This accident can be attributed 
directly to the climber not having the proper gear.
The climber took a very cavalier approach to climbing a high peak in the Rocky 
Mountains and likely did not research the descent options. The climber was 
extremely lucky that the fall was witnessed, because they had no means to escape 
the crevasse on their own. They were fortunate to land on a snow bridge after the 
25-meter fall. Had they continued falling, they would have become wedged in the 
constriction typically found at the bottom of crevasses.

Mt. Temple 
On March 23, Michelle Dvorak and Kurt Ross 
were climbing the Greenwood-Locke Route 
(1,375 meters, Grade V) on the north face 
of Mt. Temple in full winter conditions. In 
summer, the route is given a technical grade 
of 5.10+, but do not base your expectations 
on the grade. It has been climbed a handful

The team was unsure where the next pitch went. Dvorak led up a pinnacle, 
passing wooden protection from an earlier ascent, but when she reached the top 
of the tower, it seemed there was no feasible way back to the main wall. She then 
downclimbed the pinnacle to try another option. As she was making a tension 
traverse to access another possible line, a piece of protection failed. 
As Dvorak wrote on Instagram, “We were only two or three pitches away from 
the exit ramp when I made the mistake of weighting a cam so as to lower myself 
down to traverse a blank-looking slab further below.... The gear held at first, but 
given that the rock was all rather bad, it’s not really a surprise that I suddenly went 
for a long sideways ride, ripping yet another cam and fracturing a few small bones 
in my back after impacting the wall. The pain was so intense.”

Ross wrote on Instagram, “I lowered her to a small ledge then rappelled from

decided that contacting parks rescue was the safest option.” 
Dvorak and Ross used their cell phone to call for a rescue at 3:08 p.m. When the 
rescue team arrived, both climbers were at a belay anchor on a small ledge. Rescue 
was able to long-line into their location to prepare the injured climber for extraction 
off the wall. The climbing party was then long-lined off the wall in two loads.

have taken more time investigating and excavating a spine of snow that led back to 
the wall from the pinnacle. They had earlier assessed this option as unlikely.  
One challenge for the party was that much of what they had read about the climb 
was from summer ascents. The route looked different in winter conditions, adding 
significant difficulty in interpreting the information. Also, the topography of Mt. 
Temple is blocky and often nondescript limestone, without the long crack systems 
and corners that characterize other types of rock. As mentioned in an Alpinist.com 
feature, winter climbing in general on Mt. Temple “varies significantly from year

FALL FROM ANCHOR | Tether Clipped Incorrectly
Alberta, Banff National Park, Mt. Louis 
At 5 a.m. on August 20, Alistair Hall (34) and I, Adam Laycock (33), started our 
approach to attempt the Gmoser Route of Mt. Louis. While this 15-pitch 5.9 has 
bolted anchors, it is also an old-school trad route that would push our limits 
for climbing on gear. Alistair was confident in his ability to lead the crux pitch. 
Although it was our first time on this mountain, we were both locals and familiar 
with the chossy nature of the Canadian Rockies. We did plenty of research and 
felt confident in the route and conditions that day.
Our ascent was slower than we had anticipated. By the time we reached the top

of pitch six, it was midafternoon, and 
with ten pitches remaining, we decided 
to back off the climb. The belay stations 
were bolted, so we chose to descend the same way we had ascended. Rappelling 
pitches six and five was uneventful.
After I finished rappelling pitch five, I secured myself to the anchor with my 
personal anchor system (PAS). My PAS was a 120-mm nylon sling, girth-hitched 
through my belay loop, with two knots for length adjustment. The belay stance 
was narrow, prompting me to shorten my PAS by moving my locking carabiner 
to a knotted loop closer to my belay loop. I then clipped my carabiner into one of 
the rappel rings, locked it, weighted my PAS to test it, and took myself off rappel. 
I spent a few minutes preparing the rope for the next rappel, threading it through 
the rappel rings, coiling it, and adding a knot for safety.

and clipped it to my belay loop. I yelled to Alistair that I was alive and secure, but 
injured, and there was no need to descend to me.
My left ankle was visibly disfigured and unable to support weight. Unable to 
self-rescue, I used my inReach to send an SOS message. Within half an hour of my 
fall, a Parks Canada rescue helicopter located us and began the rescue.
ANALYSIS
Laycock’s accident was eerily similar 
to another suffered by a National 
Outdoor Leadership School instructor 
in Arizona (see A NAC 2022). Both fallen 
climbers had tied overhand knots in 
a 120cm length loop of 20mm sewn 
webbing to create adjustment pockets 
for a homemade PAS. This is a common 
practice. In both cases, it appears that 
the tether was not clipped correctly 
with the carabiner, but instead the knot 
caught in the bottom, non-gated end of 
the tether carabiner. 
A contributing factor to the accident 
was that Laycock’s daisy knot was 
bulky from being unevenly tied. This
------------------------------
caught in the bottom, non-gated end of

A contributing factor to the accident 
was that Laycock’s daisy knot was 
bulky from being unevenly tied. This 
increased the possibility of the knot 
sticking in the bottom of the carabiner. 
He wrote, “Despite weighting my PAS to 
test it, the poorly dressed overhand knot 
briefly supported my weight.” He added, 
“Before the knot slipped through the 
carabiner, I failed to thoroughly check my 
anchorage to account for human error.” 
It is worth noting that the critical 
section of webbing was hard to assess. The two strands that created the clipping 
pocket were of the same color and were flush with each other. Additionally, the 
rappel station was on a ledge, hampering a full weight test. In the end, sheer luck 
might have saved Laycock’s life.

anchor. When I hit the ledge, I was sitting on the tail of the rope, and I was still five 
to seven meters above the pitch-three anchor.
“Also, my helmet, though it ended up broken, allowed me to remain conscious. 
Had I been unconscious, I very well might have rolled off the narrow ledge. 
Considering what could have happened, my injuries were minor: a fractured left

STRANDED CLIMBERS | Inexperience
Alberta, Banff National Park, Mt. Cory 
At 12:20 p.m. on June 13, a party of two requested a rescue from Mt. Cory in 
Banff National Park. The party was three pitches up a rock route called Hoka Hey! 
(9 pitches, 5.9) and had just completed a sustained 5.8/5.9 corner pitch. The party 
felt dehydrated due to the heat that day and their exposure to direct sunlight. 
Although they had planned to climb in the cool morning, the approach to the 
route took longer than expected. This delay placed them on the initial pitches of 
a long climb during the heat of the day. 
The party was new to climbing in the area but had recently completed another 
multi-pitch route called Aftonroe (8 pitches, 5.7), also on Mt. Cory. Hoka Hey! 
was a step up in grade from Aftonroe, though well within their technical ability.

was a step up in grade from Aftonroe, though well within their technical ability. 
Unfortunately, the additional challenges of a longer approach, route-finding, 
sustained exposed climbing, mixed traditional and bolt protection, and the heat 
put them beyond their comfort zone. The party had also dropped a helmet and 
did not feel confident in their descent options with a single rope.
ANALYSIS
Although the party was capable, they underestimated the length and serious 
nature of the route. They may have avoided rescue by saving the climb for a cooler 
day, BY selecting a climb in the shade, or by building experience on smaller multi-
pitch routes before attempting Hoka Hey!
There are escape options on the route, but the party was underequipped and did 
not appear confident in their ability to navigate their way down. It is unknown how 
much research the party had done before embarking on the route. The climber who

much research the party had done before embarking on the route. The climber who 
dropped their helmet was the more experienced leader, and the other climber was 
relatively new to the sport. Clipping gear into the anchor and not removing your 
helmet on a multi-pitch route both reduce the chance of inadvertently dropping 
equipment. (Source: Ian Jackson, Parks Canada.)

FALL ON ROCK | Belay Failure from Above
Nuevo León, El Potrero Chico 
On March 14, a friend (the belayer) and I (Liu Yuezhang, 26) headed to Time Wave 
Zero (2,000’ III 5.12a or 5.11 A0) in El Potrero Chico to check out the approach and 
prepare for a full attempt a few days later. Our plan was to try the first two pitches 
before returning to the ground. While following the second pitch (95 feet, 5.11b, 9 
bolts), I experienced a belay failure from above and hit my right lower back, head,

before returning to the ground. While following the second pitch (95 feet, 5.11b, 9 
bolts), I experienced a belay failure from above and hit my right lower back, head, 
and both elbows as I fell. I was rescued by the El Potrero rescue team and local 
climbers. Miraculously, I was not seriously injured.
We reached the crag around noon and were glad to meet two female climbers at 
an area close to our route. They eventually performed the rescue. 
I led the first pitch (100 feet, 5.7, four bolts) and belayed my friend up. We
------------------------------
MEXICO    I    113   
switched leads, and my friend led 
the second pitch, set up a belay, and 
notified me to follow.
My partner was belaying with a 
Black Diamond ATC Guide, rigged 
in guide mode off a bolted anchor. 
(See Fig. 1, showing the anchor and 
belay configuration.) He had double-
checked the system by pulling on the 
climber’s side of the rope. I climbed 
to the eighth bolt, right before 
the crux on the pitch. I decided to 
hang to check out the moves. I said, 
“Take.” I was on the rope for five to 
ten seconds when suddenly I began to 
free-fall. I remember the sky moving 
farther and farther away, so I must 
have been falling face up. I thought I 
was going die. 
The belayer remembers releasing 
both hands at one point, after which 
the climber’s side of rope began to 
run rapidly through the ATC. In 
a panic, the belayer attempted to 
hold the climber’s rope (rather than 
the belayer’s side) to stop the fall. 
His right hand got seriously burned.

run rapidly through the ATC. In 
a panic, the belayer attempted to 
hold the climber’s rope (rather than 
the belayer’s side) to stop the fall. 
His right hand got seriously burned. 
Eventually, the rope (9.5mm, 70 
meters, almost new) stuck inside the belay device and I stopped falling in a slabby 
area, around ten feet below the pitch-one anchor. The falling distance was around 
60 to 85 feet.
From my injuries, I inferred that I hit my lower right back on a bulge, then 
struck the back of my head and both elbows before sliding on the slab. My neck and 
tongue were slightly impaired by the impact. I could not recall some details of the 
fall. I was wearing a helmet, backpack, and long-sleeve jacket. I noticed climbers 
approaching on the ground. Then, in what seemed to be the next second, they were 
above, readying to lower me. According to the belayer, I repeatedly said things like 
“Where am I?” and “Record the accident scene.”

above, readying to lower me. According to the belayer, I repeatedly said things like 
“Where am I?” and “Record the accident scene.” 
The belayer spent around ten minutes trying to feed slack efficiently after I was 
connected to the rescuer, but I also did not recall this. My consciousness came back 
to normal while I waslowered to the ground, but I still experienced some long-term 
memory loss. The rescue team and local climbers performed a rapid response. I was 
sent to an emergency room in Monterrey and luckily was not seriously injured. I 
would like to express my utmost gratitude to the El Potrero rescue team and nearby 
climbers for the speedy rescue, especially to Juliet, who was one of the climbers we 
had met earlier and who re-led the first pitch to begin lowering me.

ANALYSIS
Yuezhang wrote: 
“There were a few mistakes made. The most apparent was when the belayer 
released both hands while belaying. This should be strictly avoided even with an 
autoblock system. My fall could have been caught if the belayer had pulled on the 
correct (belayer’s) side of the rope; 
unfortunately, he attempted to pull the 
climber’s side.
“We also tried to analyze the cause 
of the autoblock-system failure. From 
the photo of the belay configuration, 
we can confirm the ATC was set up 
correctly. (The climber’s strand initially 
was on top but got pulled down beside 
the belayer strand due to the falling 
impact.) After some experiments, 
we found that the autoblock system 
might fail if (1) there was a horizontal 
component of force pulling outward 
(which might have occurred since 
the belay station was above a bulge, 
causing the belay components to lie 
against the rock) and (2) the wire of

component of force pulling outward 
(which might have occurred since 
the belay station was above a bulge, 
causing the belay components to lie 
against the rock) and (2) the wire of 
the ATC was caught by some small 
structure on the cliff. (See Fig. 2.) This 
scenario is very unusual and, again, 
can be completely avoided by always 
keeping a hand on the belayer’s side of 
the rope, but that’s the best estimation 
based on our experiments.
“I was the more experienced climber 
in the team and the belayer was the 
stronger climber. To compensate for 
the experience difference, we held two 
educational sessions in a gym and completed two local multi-pitch routes together. 
At El Potrero, we did several multi-pitch routes, safely switching leads, before the 
accident. I emphasized the importance of keeping a hand on the belayer’s rope

*Editor’s Note: It is possible that when Yuezhang called “take,” the belayer may 
have grabbed the bight carabiner (or the ATC retaining wire) to disengage the rope/
carabiner/device in order to more easily take up slack through the device. While this 
is not recommended by the manufacturer, it is not an uncommon technique. Yuezhang 
recalls, “If my memory serves me, the belayer told me he first pulled the slack when I 
called ‘take.’” Thus, it is plausible that the belayer, finding it difficult to pull in slack, 
disengaged the rope. When the bight carabiner or retaining wire is pulled upward, it

potentially allow the rope to run through the 
device in guide mode. Liu Yuezhang

also orients the rope perpendicular to the top of the ATC (as shown in Fig. 2). In this 
case, the ATC might have been pulled horizontally. If the belayer did just that, while 
Yuezhang momentarily shifted his weight on and off the rope, the rope could have 
begun to slip rapidly through the ATC. 
We know that the belayer, now panicking, mistakenly grabbed the follower’s side 
of the rope in a vain attempt to arrest the fall. His grip may have prevented the device 
from loading, that is until excruciating rope burns forced him to release the rope. 
At this point, the rope locked in the now loaded ATC. The newness of the rope also 
probably played a role. Note that in Fig. 1, the climber’s side of the rope is loaded 
adjacent to the brake side, not on top, as per the intended design. This is probably due 
to the force of the fall and the slickness/diameter of the fresh rope. Extra caution must 
be taken when using a thin and slick rope.

FALL ON SNOW | Team Fall While Roped
Puebla, Pico de Orizaba (Citlaltépetl) 
On August 20, a fall killed four people climbing Pico de Orizaba (5,636 meters), 
Mexico’s highest peak. The climbers were roped together above 5,000 meters 
on the Jamapa Glacier when one of them fell, dragging the other three down the 
mountain.
The secretary of the interior for the state of Puebla confirmed that all four 
climbers were Mexican nationals and belonged to the same group. Three of 
the deceased were from Veracruz, and one was from Puebla. The tour company 
Volcanes de México identified the fallen as Carlos Altamirano Lima (53), José 
Inés Zepahua (63), Hugo Cruz Vázquez (19), and Humberto Kenji Muray (58). 
Altamirano was guiding the group and was an experienced mountaineer.

Altamirano was guiding the group and was an experienced mountaineer. 
ANALYSIS
The standard Jamapa Glacier route (the scene of the accident) is not technically 
difficult. However, above 5,000 meters, crevasses present a hazard and the snow 
steepens to 35°. On hard snow angled at 30°, a falling climber accelerates almost as 
quickly as they would in free fall.
Although being roped together in a team of varying experience levels is 
standard for safeguarding glacier travel, it presents various hazards. The general 
principal is that if one climber falls, their fall can be arrested by one or more of the 
others. Unfortunately, on steep terrain, this can prove difficult, especially if the 
top member of the rope team falls. In an ideal world, pitching out technical terrain 
or having intermediate anchors mitigates the hazard. In reality, such steps often

top member of the rope team falls. In an ideal world, pitching out technical terrain 
or having intermediate anchors mitigates the hazard. In reality, such steps often 
are impractical, especially in situations where speed is safety.
While the uninitiated view “low-angle” snow climbing as inconsequential, 
experienced climbers understand the danger. Protection is often poor or 
nonexistent. The chances of falling are magnified by slick terrain, unstable 
footing, and falling objects. “Balling” of built-up snow on crampons and tripping 
when crampon points catch pant cuffs have killed many climbers. Self-arresting 
on steep, hard snow is very difficult. All that said, one must exercise heightened 
caution and avoid being lulled into a false sense of security when climbing steep 
snow. (Sources: Government of Puebla, ExplorersWeb.com, and the Editors.)

SKI MOUNTAINEERING
 
FALLING ICE | Poor Position, Group Dynamics
California, Sierra Nevada, Mt. Emerson 
Our party of four planned to ski the North Couloir on Mt. Emerson (13,210 feet), 
west of Bishop, on May 18. Two members of our party had skied in this area before, 
but not on Emerson specifically. The other two were visiting from out of state. 
Three of the four of us are volunteers on mountain rescue teams, and two are 
current or former licensed EMTs. 
The weather was around 40°F at the Aspendell trailhead (8,400 feet) when 
we started at 5:30 a.m. The forecast was for clear skies and a high of 70°F at that 
elevation. Our objective topped out at 
around 13,000 feet, where we expected 
lower overnight temperatures and a 
cooler high. 
We arrived at the base of the couloir

We arrived at the base of the couloir 
around 9 a.m. and found a party of 
three just starting up. We followed 
shortly after them, starting our climb 
around 9:15 a.m. One member of the 
party ahead of us soon descended, and 
we caught up with the remaining two. 
Shortly after this, we were hit by falling 
ice chunks (up to softball sized), and we 
identified a frozen waterfall about 800 
feet up the couloir, on climbers’ right, 
as the source. While the snow surface 
in the north-facing couloir was in the 
shade and quite firm, the waterfall was 
seeing its first sun at the top of the 
couloir’s wall.
We decided we would continue but 
if a similar incident happened we would 
bail. Communication of this decision 
within our party was imperfect due to 
group dynamics and being somewhat 
spread out across the couloir. After 
regrouping in a protected area on 
climbers’ left, we restarted as a team 
of four while the other party continued

(female, age 39) expressed hesitation in continuing, partly due to her perceived 
inability to maintain the pace set by the other climbers. Moving quickly and 
traveling together were emphasized as tactics for mitigating the overhead hazard.

ice and hit our group directly. We estimate some of the ice chunks were microwave 
sized. None of the party members were knocked off their feet, but Person 1 was 
struck by ice in the head while she was in self-arrest position, as evidenced by a 
large dent on the top of her helmet. She was conscious but not alert and oriented, 
and incapable of climbing farther or descending on skis. She complained of light 
neck pain, moderate shoulder pain, and moderate hip pain. She was able to move 
and sense all extremities. Persons 2 and 3 also were struck in their heads, as 
evidenced by a laceration on Person 3’s ear and both helmets showing damage. 
Neither complained of significant pain or cognitive deficits. 
The SOS feature on a Garmin inReach was activated. Persons 3 and 4 continued 
climbing to get above the hazard; they then transitioned to skis, and one person

downclimbing the couloir. Over the next 15 minutes, the injured member’s mental 
status was reassessed as alert and oriented (A&Ox4). She continued to complain 
of neck, shoulder, and hip pain, but the pain did not inhibit movement and no 
neurological deficits were observed.
Over the next 90 minutes, Persons 1 and 2 descended 800 feet to a safe zone on 
the apron below the couloir. The waterfall shed ice at least four times during this 
period, including once when large ice chunks fell down the couloir.
Inyo County SAR had initiated a call for helicopter resources but estimated 
they would not be in the area for a few hours and encouraged us to keep moving 
downhill if we were able. We made the decision to self-evacuate. We skied down 
the low-angle approach and reached the trailhead around 3 p.m.

ANALYSIS
Ultimately, poor group dynamics led to the decision to continue climbing beneath 
a known hazard. Further, the group did not have enough experience with overhead 
ice hazard to fully assess the risk and appreciate how little “moving fast” mitigates 
that risk. Large chunks of falling ice would break up on the frozen snow of the 
couloir, which meant the potential for harm from large pieces of ice increased as 
the group climbed closer to the waterfall. The group had several opportunities 
to pause and discuss climbing strategy, pacing, and overall comfort with the 
objective, but failed to do that because of an overwhelming sense of urgency to

to pause and discuss climbing strategy, pacing, and overall comfort with the 
objective, but failed to do that because of an overwhelming sense of urgency to 
move quickly.
Without observing this specific frozen waterfall frequently, it would not be 
possible to predict when it would melt and fall apart each day. We hypothesize the 
waterfall had been going through a diurnal freeze-thaw cycle, fed by a melting 
snowfield above. A much, much earlier start might have reduced the risk of being in 
a vulnerable climbing position during the bulk of the waterfall shedding. The sun 
hits the top of the couloir walls around 6 a.m. at that time of year. 
After the incident, the group successfully executed a self-rescue. In hindsight, 
skiing down 3,000 vertical feet with a fractured C1 vertebra, in excellent weather 
and with plenty of time to wait for air rescue, was not a perfect decision. The team
------------------------------
118  I  ACCIDENTS IN NORTH AMERICAN CLIMBING 2024
lacked knowledge of cervical spine mechanisms of injury, learning later that a 
significant axial load (large ice chunk to the head) followed by immediate neck 
pain (even minor pain) is indicative of possible fracture. The medical assessments 
in the field were thorough, but all parties were distracted by the dangerous and 
stressful situation of falling ice in the couloir. The team’s medical training and 
experience in rescue led to the decision to very quickly self-extricate from the 
couloir to avoid further injury. (Source: Person 1.)

they discussed the deteriorating conditions and the possibility of turning around. 
Soon after this discussion, a natural wet loose avalanche released at about 11,940 
feet, about 400 feet above the party, and swept both individuals down the slope. 
Skier 1 was carried over a cliff band, and both parties were partially buried. 
After coming to rest, Skier 2 had a hand free and was able to clear their face, dig 
themselves out, and initiate a search for Skier 1, who was partially buried with a leg 
exposed. Skier 2 was able to locate and extract them quickly. After assessing Skier 1’s 
condition, Skier 2 initiated a rescue via an inReach at approximately 11:45 a.m. 
Skier 1 sustained critical injuries during the avalanche, and their condition

the rescue team, Skier 1 did not survive their injuries.
 
ANALYSIS
This season’s record-breaking snowfall and abnormally cold spring led to substantial 
snow coverage lasting well into the summer months. This allowed for better-than-
usual access for backcountry skiers and riders. It also meant the snowpack was

subjected to atypical weather inputs, including intense solar radiation, summer rain

reminder that the snowpack remains dynamic—and destructive avalanches are still 
possible—during the spring and summer months. 
Overnight temperatures measured at the South Lake weather plot (9,600 feet), 
near the site of this incident, remained near or above freezing for several days 
leading up to the accident. In early summer, the north face of Hurd Peak receives 
solar input shortly after sunrise. The shallow nature of this slope and exposed rock 
features encourage rapid warming. Cloud cover on the evening of June 13 may also 
have limited the overnight refreeze potential.

It’s also important to note that the approach and lower flanks of the north face

On the morning of the accident, 
a solo skier climbed and descended 
the face at approximately 9 a.m., 
observing signs of impending snow 
instability, including wet surface 
snow and deep boot penetration on 
the climb. This skier triggered a small 
wet loose avalanche at the top of the 
path and carefully descended the 
bed surface. The skier did not see the 
party that would be involved in the 
accident later that morning.
This accident is a tragic reminder 
that snow conditions can change 
dramatically from one day to the 
next and that even a relatively small 
avalanche can have devastating 
consequences in steep and rocky 
terrain. (Source: Eastern Sierra Avalanche Center.)

Washington, North Cascades, Slate Mountain 
On Wednesday, March 15, a skier and a snowboarder departed from Heather 
Meadows near the Mt. Baker Ski Area, planning to climb and descend both Herman 
and Slate mountains. They climbed the south side of Mt. Herman to 6,000 feet (about 
250 feet below the top) and then descended an eastern aspect. During the descent, 
the snowboarder triggered a shallow slab avalanche atop a short, steep rollover just 
above the traverse to Slate Mountain. 
The pair then climbed the east side of Slate to its 6,209-foot summit. At around 
1 p.m., they began their descent by a series of connected chute and ramp features 
on the southeast face, a line known locally as the Dog Leg or Z Couloir. The skier 
descended first and triggered a size D2.5 slab avalanche at the very top of the run. He

ANALYSIS
The southeast face of Slate Mountain consists of rocky, sparsely treed terrain 
broken by numerous cliffs. All lines of descent require extensive travel on 35°–
45° terrain, in addition to navigation around rock buttresses and large cliffs. 
The month prior to the avalanche was marked by extended periods of snowfall 
at cold temperatures, alternating with high pressure. March 6 to 9 brought sun, 
near-freezing mid-day temperatures, and light winds. This combination allowed 
for surface warming on southerly aspects. Rollerballs and other signs of warming 
were observed during this period. 
From March 10 to 14, a series of storms produced two to three feet of new 
snow at a similar elevation and aspect to the avalanche site. Gradually clearing 
skies and mild temperatures on March 14 were followed by a few inches of new 
snow in the early morning of March 15, transitioning to partly cloudy skies and

skies and mild temperatures on March 14 were followed by a few inches of new 
snow in the early morning of March 15, transitioning to partly cloudy skies and

A sun crust had formed during the high pressure from March 6 to 9, and 
the new snow formed a slab on top of it. The avalanche bed surface is believed 
to have been the crust buried on March 10. The avalanche began on a slope 
estimated at 40° and left a crown estimated at 1.5 to 2 feet high, approximately 
50 feet wide at the start zone. (Source: Northwest Avalanche Center.)
*Editor’s Note: The avalanche hazard was rated “moderate” for the day of the 
slide (the second highest of five levels). The first lines of the forecast read, “You can 
still trigger slab avalanches in steep terrain. Stick to moderately angled slopes and 
navigate around trigger points like convex rolls, unsupported terrain above or around 
cliffs, or wind loaded slopes just below ridgeline.”

was very soft and deep, so the ascent took two hours. As I reached the top of the 
couloir, the wind and snow made visibility by headlamp impossible, so I stopped 
to bivy against a rock face below the ridgeline. In the morning, the wind was still 
whipping pretty badly, so I decided to forgo the summit and traverse attempt. 
I packed up camp, put on my skis, and began my descent. The snow was good 
(powder with a slight crust in places). Everything seemed fine until my fourth 
turn, when my outside ski released and shot down the mountain. I had a Whippet 
pole and tried to self-arrest, but could not find solid purchase with the Whippet. 
I ended up on my back and began sliding into a chute with rocks on either side. 
My body rotated and I hit one shoulder and the side of my head on the rocks,

then began to tomahawk down the slope as my second ski caught on the rocks 
and ejected. I landed feet-first in some deep powder, felt a sharp pain in my knee, 
then went face-first into the snow. Luckily, I was still holding my Whippet, and I 
was able to self-arrest before falling the rest of the way down the couloir. 
I had some minor bruising on my shoulder and a tweaked knee, and my head 
felt a little foggy. I had been wearing a Petzl climbing helmet, and it sustained 
most of the damage. I stabilized my knee with a metal piece of my pack and an ACE 
bandage, and was able to self-rescue back to the car.
ANALYSIS
Every time I venture into the mountains, I keep safety in the forefront of my 
mind. I checked avalanche conditions (the hazard was “low” at all elevations), 
watched the weather, wore a helmet, and was acutely aware of my surroundings 
and skill level going into this adventure. The snow conditions in the couloir were

watched the weather, wore a helmet, and was acutely aware of my surroundings 
and skill level going into this adventure. The snow conditions in the couloir were 
variable, but I felt very comfortable with the idea of skiing down. 
There was no damage to the bottom of my skis indicating I had hit a rock, nor 
any issues with my boots. (I was using G3 ZED 12 bindings and Scarpa Maestrale 
RS boots.) What I would have done differently is to triple-check that there was 
nothing obstructing the binding’s pins in my boots, and I would have chosen to 
lock the toe bindings. Locking the toes creates its own risks, but it would lower 
the probability an unexpected release in no-fall terrain. 
I did not plan to descend that couloir and was not intending to ski terrain with 
such high consequences. When attempting a decent like this, it would have been 
prudent to have a partner in the event of an accident. (Source: Dan Apodaca.)

A skier captured images of his own sliding fall down a couloir on Little Bear Peak, a Colorado 14er. 
He impacted rocks in the choke but fortunately stopped soon below and was not very seriously 
injured. Dan Apodaca

DATA TABLES
These  tables  include  data  from  all  accidents  in  the  United  States  and  Canada  that  are  reported  in  this  
book, plus additional accidents for which data were available. Many climbing accidents each year are 
not reported. [For 2022, fewer reports than usual were received from Kentucky, West Virginia, and certain 
other areas.] Therefore, these tables should not be viewed as precise counts of annual climbing accidents, 
and the data may not represent trends completely accurately. Readers likely will find the most value in the 
distribution and patterns of accident demographics and causes in Tables II and III.

“Fall on snow” and “anchor failure” were added in 2021, starting with 2019 data. (Past editions 
combined falls on snow and ice.) “Protection pulled out” combines two former categories; in this 
section, the protection pulling out must directly cause the fall. Data from 2022 incidents is missing.
*** 
Categories introduced in 2021, starting with 2019 data, include “Protection pulled out (climber 
placed)” and “Protection pulled out (fixed)”; these replaced “Nut/cam pulled out” and “Piton/
ice screw pulled out.” Other new categories in 2021 were “Inadequate knot,” “Inadequate 
backup,” “Rope too short,” and “Failure to self-arrest.” Data from 2022 incidents is missing.

reflects solo climbers.
2 
These are illnesses/injuries that led directly or indirectly to an accident or rescue, such as HAPE.
3 
Prior years included some lowering errors, anchor failures, and inadequate backups (now their 
own categories). 
4 
This category covers ski mountaineering. Backcountry ski touring or snowshoeing incidents, 
including those involving avalanches, are not counted in these tables.
5 
These included broken ice dam, impaled on cam lobe, and rope severed by carabiner.
6 
Categories introduced in 2016. 
7 
These included snakebite, crushed by boulder, compartment syndrome, and others. Note: Injuries 
are counted only once in each category for a given incident. For example, an accident that results 
in two broken ankles will be listed once under “Fracture: lower extremity.”
